lamar special guest to be announced tickets with on sale friday zane lowe grab a seat grab a seat so you remember this place graduation i was also thinking about some of the other things we've done as well with the bbc like abbey road sprung to mind with the strings kanye west oh yeah that was good that suit was like i would've worn something different if i could look back right now i could still do a suit i just wouldn't have done that exact lapel situation zl but talk about really putting yourself on the line with that that was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and to give yourself that objective what are your thoughts when you think back about abbey road where it's just nuts kw i thought it was good i thought it was what i was supposed to do at that time if i see something if i see an opportunity i'm gonna go for it we're all gonna die one day zl yeah that's true kw so live like that live like you could die tomorrow go for it those steps have been the platforms that allowed me to make it this far zl and you have man and you're here six original albums of your own a throne record various records with g o o d music to talk about but seriously man yeezus bravo dude i mean that is one of the most creative records of any genre i've heard in a very very long time and just in terms of your output your most exciting sounding record i think kw oh thank you very much yeah i feel i was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again not having to speak with the textures of the time cause you know cruel summer is definitely kanye west and there's something weird and kind of off about mercy like when it has the high pitched impersonates noise that type of sound it sounds like art still a little bit even though it obviously was a radio smash but when i get into the idea the trap drums and things like that certain songs that are blatant radio hits it's like i'm speaking with today's textures if you look at it years from now it's not going to stand out in the way that s or yeezus stands out and can completely push or redefine or make people say hey i completely hate that or i completely love that but let me just think differently because everybody is bound to these no pun intended they're bound to sixteen bars or eight bars and the normal radio thing i was talking to frank ocean about this and said my mom got arrested for the sit ins and now we're more like the sit outs like sit off of radio and say hey radio come to us we need to find something new because it's being controlled in a way and manufactured in a way that really awesome artists can make amazing music and not break as far past as like something that's very formulaic zl so it almost feels like a duty to you in a weird way having the peoples' ear having peoples' attention for great music to be able to say well if i'm not challenging them enough i'm not challenging myself not challenging radio what am i doing kw yeah i'm not trying to regurgitate myself i showed people that i understand how to make perfect dark fantasy could be considered to be perfect i know how to make perfect but that's not what i'm here to do i'm here to crack the pavement and make new grounds sonically and society culturally zl you've done that with yeezus it's fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now because normally when i talk to artists about records of this nature it's in the lead up to something so we're all kind of playing a guessing game you know what i mean you could tell me what you think of the record but i'm trying to find my way around it the audience probably won't have heard it in this case it's been out for a minute so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight too you've seen what everyone else has had to say about this record both good and bad but i'm fascinated to know today how you would describe yeezus as someone who made it how you would describe that record kw i just think that i'm a production person i'm a product guy i'm a producer so if i'm working on a john legend album i'm gonna try to give john legend the best home for him to stay in and i'm gonna try to push pusha t no pun intended once again this keeps happening to me to make the thing that represents what i like about his music the most and then for me as kanye west i gotta fuck shit up zl and you did dude seriously from the minute it starts i mean seriously plays opening to on sight it's disgusting so you're up in the loft probably at this point and you're kicking around ideas and you're putting things together and this sound comes into your head and you're like this is what i'm looking for kw nah this is me going to the studio with thomas and guy manuel who's daft punk they had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there this is just one session right here this beat was originally like minutes long and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted and i ended up making that the intro zl you know i got a beef with you over this track it's too short i wanted more out of it cause it's one of the best beats on the record for me and it feels like you're just getting warmed up was that kind of deliberate to pull back after only a couple of verses and go you know what we're going to get on with the album now kw nah it's just what i felt like it should be zl just a dance thing kw and you know originally blood on the leaves was supposed to be first zl wow kw which psychologically i know would have changed certain yeezus naysayers about the album it wasn't that time for me i didn't want to come up there and perform a lot of times music can be presented as a service position but i wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music you know people go on a vacation and say you got the drugs you got the music you got the wine it's in that territory but i wanted to speak up and say okay so my voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music it's the only place where i actually have a deal so i can only consistently make things in music so i'm gonna take music and i'm gonna try to make it three dimensional like on star wars and the hologram'll pop up out of r d i'm gonna try to make something that jumps up and affects you in a good or bad way whether it's i'm going into a scream in the middle of the track because that's just the way i feel but i'm not here to make easy listening easy programmable music zl no you're so off the reservation on this album in the best possible way like you talked about the way you use your voice in different ways you don't rely on conventional rhyming flows your opening line yeezus season approaching you know a monster's awoken you're laying it out there this isn't my beautiful dark twisted fantasy part i'm wilding out on this record straight away plays interlude from on sight and then from nowhere as well we just get treated to these wonderful moments where like you say it's almost like a collage like you're sitting here going you know why can't i go into this why not kw you can zl and you did kw that's how life is it's like a car crash you could just be driving and just out of nowhere it happens zl at what point did that very deliberate feel to the record whereby breaks come in and join this really discordant electronic moments and everything seems to exist in this very contradictory but it works kind of way at what point did that start to take shape because it is very omnipresent through the record as a whole the way it flips between one and the other was that in your head early on or did that come towards the end when you started to reduce the record kw well i didn't reduce it rick rubin reduced it he's not a producer he's a reducer laughs zl but was it always part of the process for you to say why don't i take elements of this and this and just claps hands together bolt it together kw yeah it's just the way i was consuming information in my life at the time negative information to positive information from the internet just going to the louvre going to furniture exhibits and understanding that trying to open up and do interviews like this learning more about architecture taking one thousand meetings attempting to get backing to do clothing and different things like that getting no headway whatsoever it was just that level of frustration this is what frustration fucking sounds like this is what frustration sounds like for me as kanye west i would not be kanye west if it wasn't for michael jackson i was with quincy jones a couple days ago at john legend's wedding quincy was telling me it wasn't just mike but these guys broke down the barriers of course you know michael jackson he had to fight to get his video played because he was black this is michael jackson michael jackson's not even black he's michael jackson you know what i mean he's so crazy how can he even be classified as this black artist so for me in my life and creativity it's been challenging and everything but i was able to ascend to massive heights because of the foundation that my mother and my father and my grandfather laid through civil rights what michael jackson did with music videos and the ground he broke there would be no kanye west if it wasn't for michael jackson that allowed him to be that right now let's take people who have issues with me as kanye west they classify my motivational speeches as rants like why is he saying that why is he doing that well i've reached a point in my life where my truman show boat has hit the painting and i've got to a point that michael jackson did not break down i have reached the glass ceiling as a creative person as a celebrity when i say that it means i want to do product i am a product person not just clothing but water bottle design architecture everything that you could think about and i've been at it for years and i look around and i say hey wait a second there's no one around here in this space that looks like me and if they are they're quiet as fuck so that means wait a second now we're seriously in a civil rights movement like people used to joke about remember our south park photo remember how funny that was do you think there would be a givenchy in the hood if it wasn't for that south park photo but no one thinks about that no one thinks about the names i got called for wearing tight jeans zl you reference that in the record you talk about that no one's liked him since he's been wearing tight jeans everybody knows you brought back real rap i mean you reference that in the record kw i'm saying y'all had all that but i brought real rap back i'm going to do dope things and i wanna take this opportunity to speak to something because i go to hypebeast sometimes to look at the new things that're coming out and every time my name goes up there's a series of people who write just negative comments they wanna joke around and say why is he still trying why is he doing this they like diss me as a person for trying now mind you i've brought years of product that has added to humanity and now what they don't realize when i say hey this is pusha t this is what it is i have to remind pusha t that he's pusha t because the radio if they're not playing a song of his that has an r b hook on it or works at a certain level of trap tempo and plays in clubs it's like we forget about that clipse album that meant everything and the reason why i relate it to design and what we do in design is saying that's the music that us as creatives that wanted to get into design we looked at clipse as the gods and this is our soundtrack to creativity and it's not a trap beat that comes in on that soundtrack to creativity no knock to trap cause i did can't tell me nothing i like it but it's been commercialized to the point where and i'm not mentioning no names but people used to use the term r b nigga but then it was rappers but then rappers didn't wanna be no r b nigga now the rappers is the new r b niggas the rapper's the new radio like where's the culture at where is the culture at so then i scream and i'm sitting in the middle of it whether i'm at a dinner with anna wintour or i'm at a listening session with pusha or me and virgil are in rome giving designs to fendi over and over and gettin' our designs knocked down brought the leather jogging pants years ago to fendi and they said no how many motherfuckers you done seen with a leather jogging pant meaning when i see hedi slimane and it's all like ok this is my take on the world yeah he got some nice jeans in there some nice ones here and there some good shit here and there but we culture rap the new rock n' roll we culture rap is the new rock n' roll we the rock stars zl it's been like that now for a minute kw it's been like that for a minute hedi slimane it's been like that for a minute we the real rock stars and i'm the biggest of all of 'em i'm the number one rock star on the planet click here for part kanye west we the real rockstars and i'm the biggest of all of them i'm the biggest rock star on the planet zane lowe there it is that record it says that that's what your album says when you come out and there are songs on there where you make it very clear kw so what i want to explain to everybody out there it's like i make music i can do it but i shouldn't be limited to only one place of creativity and it's literally only like one of two reason why i haven't been able to break that down zl but why should you feel that you are because kw no this is the thing you guys don't understand you guys don't understand you guys don't understand that i did the yeezys and they ebay'd for thousand dollars and people wanted them bad as whatever right but i didn't get a call from nike the next day you guys don't understand that i've met with companies and they say what we're trying to figure out is how we can control you and control that if you're an architect and you're a world builder and you have all these ideas and you're gaudi and you want to build buildings if you don't ever get that out what's gonna happen zl isn't that why you do it isn't it the process isn't it point to do it kw i don't think you're really hearing what i'm saying zl i'm trying to kw as a creative for you to have done something to the level of the yeezys and not be able to create more and you cannot you cannot create that on your own with no support with no backing so when i say clean water was only served to the fairer skinned what i'm saying is we're making products with chitlins t shirts that's the most we can make t shirts we could have our best perspective on t shirts but if it's anything else hand smack your truman show boat is hitting the wall and what's more important to me about this than everything i can do sonically and everything is if i go somewhere else and someone says hey we don't like kanye west you've heard that before right what people don't realize is i want to make uniforms for my high school basketball team through brand yeezy i want to make that one step and then make another step and eventually do uniforms for the entire city then i want those uniforms to be hot and make money then i eventually want to be the anchor and the force behind a billion dollar company and after i make that billion dollar step then i can go in and say i have an opinion on this and that could be a ten billion dollar step i eventually want to be the anchor of the first trillion dollar company but when you sit and you have a meeting with a company and show them the most innovate take on theatre because you thought of it one night when you were sitting on top of watch the throne set which you designed with es devlin and i designed the set with es devlin and thought of ok surround vision there should be a screen above you below you to the left to the right of you and one in front of you also then i paid my own money that i get paid for doing gold digger which i never really liked that song but i always knew i would get paid for doing gold digger then i shoot a film in qatar with three camera crews with nate brown virgil matt williams nabil all of these crew all of the people that every video that pops up every other day on hypebeast thats my crew right so we go out and shoot that camera crews over days edited over days show it at amfar no show it in cannes the night before amfar on the beach build it in a pyramid with rem koolhaas' agency design the entire thing put editors in it blah blah blah people give a standing ovation i do an interview in new york times the next year to say hey i did this and i want to let you know i did it right and then it doesn't get mentioned in the interview and a week later they do an interview with george lucas and steven spielberg and they're talking about what the next frontier of theatre will be and how it'll be higher priced tickets and it'll be something that's surrounding you and blah blah blah maybe it's in the goggles i said wait a second i just only did the interview to tell people that i invented it i made it like i went i remember when i was uh dropping william morris right and then sarah newkirk at that time said before you drop them go meet with ari emanuel and i sat with him and i said ari i'm an inventor and he goes on to tell me about the way it works and what he said was you are a celebrity so basically what's going to happen is there's product here and this is where you end up right here if you can communicate the product you can make money of the product cause look at gaga she's the creative director of polaroid i like some the gaga songs what the fuck does she know about cameras so it becomes all of this thing where all of the musicians the musicians try to get more money by promoting other products right so you'll say hey you know what i've got this water and we've got you know we've got this red version we got a red bottle and we've got a david beckham version here then we got a blue version so my opinion is no more than the patina on top of it when i understand the reason from my core of why something should work all the way through so i understand we want to make it about music but i wanted to take this step to say we got this new thing called classism it's racism's cousin this is what we do to hold people back this is what we do and we got this other thing we got that has been working for a long time where you don't have to be racist anymore it's called self hate it works on itself it's like real estate of racism where just like that when someone comes up and says something like i am a god everybody says who does he think he is i just told you who i thought i am a god i just told you that's who i think i am would it have been better if i had a song that said i am a nigga or if i had song that said i am a gangsta or if i had song that said i am a pimp all those color and patinas fit better on a person like me right but to say you are a god especially when you got shipped over to the country that you're in and your last name is a slave owners how can you say that how could you have that mentality zl i mean i know in the past you've talked about like you know building hotels doing things beyond people's normal frame of reference they know you as kanye west an artist they know you're moving into fashion but these things in a way i guess are hard on people to comprehend because they don't have that level of drive do you know what i mean has it always been like this for you have you always felt like you can set your mind on anything and you will achieve it ultimately kw i've always felt i can do anything that's the main thing people are controlled by thoughts the perceptions of themselves they're slowed down by the perception of themselves if you're taught you can't do anything you won't do anything i was taught i could do everything and i'm kanye west at age so just watch the next ten years zl yea yea yea february university park pa bryce jordan center february baltimore md baltimore arena february newark nj prudential center february montreal quebec bell centre february hamilton ontario copps coliseum february albany ny times union center february uncasville ct mohegan sun arena february atlantic city nj boardwalk hall february uniondale ny nassau coliseum well seeing that i think i maybe for one of the first times in my life i understand how it is to feel humbled i want to say some thank you s really quick thank god for stephen hill who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn't care about what ghost somebody's driving or how big somebody's house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic current and futuristic black music every day so make some noise for stephen hill to start this so since this is pre taped and the fact that adam blackstone used to be my music director i'm pretty sure he's not gonna start the music on me if i go chicago for a second you know it was interesting when i went and visited minister louis farrakhan and i just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that i had been talking about over the past couple years and it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation you know at the barbershop and everything i used to hear people talking about you know when an entertainer get on of course you know he gon' go and get a white girl and buy her all this and the white girl gon' go and get a rich black dude but i want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes so it ain't got nothing to do with the money and it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father robert kardashian walked out and on the side of his bentley they wrote nigga lover because robert kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got o j off she had never seen her father curse get mad he was the most laid back human being and he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down and she sat there crying and said dad why you going so crazy he said to her one day you may have a black child a beautiful beautiful beautiful black child and it's gonna be hard you're gonna see how hard it is so true enough we deal with racism because there are different races or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races as opposed to the macro which is the human race the bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why i'm not allowed to be empowered is because of race because of people's perception of celebrity because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper but not the idea of becoming an owner and they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy idea harriet tubman said she could have freed so many more and i'm sorry mom if that was incorrect english harriet tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren't free so don't think that because we can afford this custom balmain suit that we're free and don't think that because we can buy a car that we're free and don't think that because it's of a gated community that has colored people in it that we're free it's the mentality the slave mentality where we all eventually become slaves to that car slaves to the perception slaves to the idea of being cool i thought it was so appropriate the way wayne brady kicked his whole shit off tonight for us to express ourselves our power our oil since we don't own any oil our oil is our expression is our influence don't never let them take that away and when we have the chance to express it and influence don't only do it for us do it for the human race zane lowe nice to see you again man thanks for stopping by the bbc for a chat kanye west good to see you too sir thank you zane lowe so i was thinking today like where do we begin because you ve been having some remarkable conversations lately some really in depth really interesting conversations addressing recent things that have gone on you know successes things that have kind of made people think talk amongst themselves and it got me thinking like where were we last time we were months ago not far from here and so much has changed in the last months the first question i wanted to ask you cause i ve always wondered how you felt at that time kanye west i had so many interviews where i m trying to express that i can create that i can create outside of just the music box and i m giving examples of work that i did that was really successful and i m getting just completely shut down but not just by the company we talked about last time but every single company every single company you could imagine is just like no you are celebrity you are not allowed to create you re not allowed to think you re not allowed to have an opinion you re just here to wear a red leather jacket and shut up and it s true that as a celebrity you can help to promote something quickly but no one wanted to allow me to think or be involved in the product and you know as i told you last time i said i m a product guy zane lowe yea and it was an electrifying conservation and i mean it felt like you were taking names that day it felt like you were also trying to reach people that day and what s occurred since you know is you have made serious moves into that world you know what s happened recently with yeezy supply you know your deal with adidas how has that experience been overall for you now with product out and with peoples opinion about the shoes and about what they ve seen how has that experience been for you how can you put that into context for us kanye west i mean every day when you go to the gym or you go to work it s a challenge you gotta work hard and you have to completely tirelessly countlessly remind people of your vision no matter what so that s the way i mma word it you know what i m saying so we made it to a point where something extremely close something almost to the level something past the level of the vision finally hit the globe and adidas was a company that was flexible enough and had been used to dealing with creatives enough to allow me to create something that was very close to my heart you know they original hip hop zane lowe of course run dmc man i mean they were right there at the very beginning it was kind of a perfect partnership when it was announced you know not long after and i wondered when did the conversation actually begin with adidias after you starting talking about your aspirations and what you wanted to achieve in that industry kanye west that conversation had already started before then there was a few conversations with a few companies with a few sportswear companies and um i remember calling jon wexler you know it was a certain point where i just felt like i couldn t breathe anymore like i had all these ideas and i felt like i was literally gasping for oxygen because if anyone s creative you know like we have this idea of a mass market looking at a celebrity that owns a lamborghini complaining about something and anyone that s creative understands that there s no amount of money that can be given to them to make them not want to or have to create there s no check out and there s no cheque to stop you from creative no pun intended when i m saying no check zane lowe was a good one though kanye west just even thinking about it takes the breath out of me because i mean as soon as we got the opportunity to actually start making things there were so many ideas i mean i look at over images a day on my laptop and i remember i went into the whole thing about hypebeast you know i said people be dissing me on hypebeast and it s like wait a second dude like i been fighting this battle for a long time since like universe city like no one has any idea what the meeting were like i mma throw this one out here i remember this one guy that worked for francois pinault the head of kering group came up in my apartment in paris while i was working on yeezus and i had a meeting with him and it was related to doing a deal with puma and the guy actually i forgot about the meeting right so i had my jacket on and it was a jacket i had done with a p c and i was about to leave so he shows up at the door and we go to my dining room table and i m sitting with him and i tell him like yo i made this jacket and he makes some joke about you know you did look pretty hot i m happy to know that you put on all those clothes for me zane lowe was he joking do you think kanye west he was leveling he was leveling the conversation this is what people do all the time like if i meet someone who i respect or i look up to i will literally like kiss their feet you know someone that i know that s put in a lot of work and it s a lot of agents a lot of people who work under the main guy that will level that will try to level you you know when they talk to you they talk down to you and i m just sitting like whoa ok obviously i have to show him like hey i m working on this stuff and it s coming out good and this is all i have a chance to work on you know like when i worked with a p c i only had two times to look at the collection you know i couldn t really grab it and dig into it the way i dig into like working on all of the lights or something like that it s like there s a timeline a cut off switch especially when you re dealing with apparel and the way that people make apparel currently zane lowe i can imagine the frustration for you at that moment in time as you re leading up to what has effectively occurred in the last year seeing something like you say close to the vision you have in your mind at those early stages man the frustration of trying to get those ideas out and just like you said and getting just levelled kanye west everyone everyone i talked to would try to level me you know and then there was this guy named hermann deininger that was the head of adidas and i say was because he passed away recently and i showed him what i shot in qatar the cruel summer film that was using screens the surround vision idea which we ve never shown online because you have to experience it in it s space it s the same thing i showed disney and universal and said you know this is the new frontier on the way we need to see film and which i got all no s on that to date and this guy hermann saw it and he believed he believed that maybe i had something more than how big my rap record was in me he could tell he knew he s like this guy has something to say and to give that s past the current box that he s put in and he made sure hermann and jon wexler made sure that adidas deal got done and the deal has nothing to do with the idea of the higher ups in society the deal is all about the moment when i can bring a shoe to a kid a foot locker and get on my knees and take it back to when i worked at the gap and put the shoes on his feet that is what the deal is about the deal is about when the star of a show is a foot girl when there s never been a foot girl as the star of any fashion show the deal is when the kids came to locations across the world to see yeezy season x adidas originals launch and the excitement that was in that theater and when they saw that line up they saw that brigade they reacted to it when they heard wolves when they saw the boots when they saw the runners when they saw the matrix sweaters when they saw all these things like hitting them back to back to back to back this is what i fought for none of this was about me having like a bigger house a faster lamborghini it like it wasn't about that it was about these kids having a moment to be themselves to be a stronger version you know of themselves i make this stuff to empower people i feel like there's so many things that are made to you know to wear the people as opposed to people wearing it and i asked my assistant one time i was like how does these clothes make you feel she said i feel powerful and that's our that's our main goal as the song says no one man should have all that power no one man should have it everyone should have it zane lowe you seem to be totally well a lot more aware of what it is that well in a much sort of like a more focused way you're able to know where you wanna be and what impact you wanna have and it feels like you're very attached to the well being of the people and what they can get out of this you know and across the border and when that moment kind of occurred to you cause that doesn't happen overnight you know there's but it does lead up to that and months ago you were fighting you know you were like really fighting to be heard and now it seems to me like you're very consciously aware kanye west yeah i was still off you know what i mean i might have some things that are off now but i feel like in the same way when i came up with all falls down and i was able to differentiate myself from whoever i was trying to rap like at that point and i found my voice and my message it's like i felt like zane lowe that was the moment you felt like that was yeah kanye west when i wrote all falls down that's when i was like okay this is who i am in the this is what i'm this is what i'm presenting so now i feel like it's funny i would always say you know i wanna sculpt with marble and it wasn't until i was working on yeezus and i was learning about furniture and the fact that i am a rich person that afforded me the opportunity to go to french flea markets and the galleries and buy you know like furniture that get charged that rich people get charged a lot for and one of the things they had was this le corbusier lamp and it was made of cement and it was this beautiful sculpture that was it really inspired me because he made it for zeus so he made it for everyone and it was made of cement so it wasn't the material it was the idea that was the most important and i always wanted the resources of lvmh but it wasn't until i started taking the sensibility of proportion and color and finishing and applying it to fleece and jersey french terry which is a cement in comparison to you know the type of materials that louis vuitton might use that i find a message a voice a reason a reason to create you know it was a futile argument for me to say hey everyone get behind me so i can make another jacket that you can afford it's like insane but now i feel people rallying because they know that i wanna fight for h m zara type concept and i know that adidas can eventually get those price points and i want to apologize to everyone right now because i believe that season may still be in that upper price point and there's still the words exclusivity you know being thrown around exclusivity is the new n word not nigga exclusivity am i saying the word right zane lowe yeah kanye west yeah that is the new n word cause nothing should be exclusive everyone should have the opportunity to drink from the same fountain the idea of exclusivity is a new colored people fountain concept and saying we're gonna overcharge sneaker culture guys to you know drink at the right fountain you know we have to reboot our mentality period of a generation you know it wouldn't even matter if i sold one sweatshirt you know as long as this interview gets done and kids hear this and know this and or someone in position of power or someone that will be in a position of power in the future has a chance to make a difference and they say someone who was at the lowest point grabbing at straws express themselves freely and overcame it through all adversary all adversity means that they can do the same thing you know zane lowe yeah because the thing is when people hear you talking at times i think that there's a genuine consensus from those cause believe me you're compelling to a lot of people and you know what you say is i think you have very unique views on things that should be heard but some people i think have thought overtime that they've obviously missed the point they've thought that you bringing it back to you but you're actually trying to open up to everybody else you're trying to break down that barrier of exclusivity and say you know if you have to lead the way you have to lead the way it might not end with you but maybe if it starts with you is your point kanye west and i was i was using the wrong words my rap was wrong you know what i'm saying i was getting the drinks you know thrown in my face as opposed to leaving with the girl at the end of the night you know cause imagine think about the type of shit wild shit you say in interviews and imagine if someone said this very thing to a girl at a bar yo what up baby i'm a genius they be like yo who's this guy no i'm telling you i sold all this i sold this many shoes then she be like yo chill chill like gosh get me out of here already you know what i'm saying and that's who i was and that was that frustration i had cause i'm seeing like this i'm looking at this girl like man i know that zane lowe we could be good together this could work kanye west yeah i know i just don't know how to work it zane lowe so i'm messing it up yeah kanye west and the right way so i'm gonna stumble i was like the year old virgin of dealing with like corporations and stuff you know zane lowe you're the year old virgin of dealing with corporations kanye west yeah i did not know how to communicate at all and it's like i had my point my message was you know simply like your egg my semen we change the world you know and i imagine that that's gonna sound wrong zane lowe that's a hell of a pick up line man kanye west i mean i like saying shit that sounds wrong anyway you know because wrong is okay you know like zane lowe it's okay it's okay wrong kanye west we have the right to be wrong sometimes zane lowe that's a great line you know i wanted to talk to you when we started talking you know a while back music was on my agenda because you know i mean we talked a couple times before as well and you know i'm a music guy i mean it really drives me and it's a big part of my life and over the course of this conversation you know i wanna ask you at some point what the future looks like and feels like to you cause i'm fascinated in the certain things i wanna touch on but i do want to talk about your forthcoming new record if that's cool do you want to talk about music kanye west yeah zane lowe cause to me it feels like over the course of that frustration last time you had to make sacrifices to be heard and it felt like you didn't really wanna talk about yezus you were like that's cool and everything but i wanna talk about this and lately i just maybe i'm i feel like you're really energized with music in a big way kanye west you know after i did the presentation in new york i was able to get that alien out of my stomach you know like i was on a flight back in the morning to go shoot the blessings video with big sean and drake zane lowe yeah kanye west and i couldn't have been happier to go and shoot this video with two of the hottest rappers in the game well let's be respectful and truthful the hottest rapper and one of the hottest rappers in the game and i fall somewhere in that you know in that that field so zane lowe getting back to music for a minute i feel like we're right back i gotta bring you right back for a second i want to know what we can look forward to on this record you talked about cookout music you talked about what this album represents and every record you have made has been something new and fresh you've taken yourself and your craft to a new place where's your head at right now with this new album kanye west just working hard on it zane lowe and it's fun kanye west and it's fun and it's fun to work hard and we're being inventive and i've still got some you know a lot of opinions and perspectives that i think are important and very can be inspiring to people that fight and you know the college dropout came out of a fight to want to rap and this new album is coming out of a fight of wanting to design and zane lowe i wondered about that cause yeezus was punk rock to me that was like that was sex pistols to me that was like public enemy to me that was one of the records that stands as establishing an industrial strong statement and i wondered like where the desire is coming from on this record and without giving away too much cause the proof is in the hearing the joy is in the hearing where it's coming from kanye west i mean it's a joyful noise onto the lord like it is still you know the struggle you know but the beauty from the struggle you know zane lowe as opposed to just the struggle kanye west yea the song amazing grace you know coming out of the worst pain possible and making the most beautiful song you know possible you know i wanna perform only one as many times as possible you know could be vilified or misunderstood and like i said i didn t come here to be liked i came here to make a difference i m not talking about this interview i m talking about life some people s job they re very extremely likeable and i think i could figure that out i think i m way nicer to people just in general everyone i meet i m extremely nice but as soon as people start playing games i stop i stop playing games and at any moment i can hit that ye button and we can go right back to day one people be forgetting though they be forgetting real quick but it s all love and great energy and positive energy i like the i like the differences of views and our approach to music like when i m sitting making music with paul mccartney and i come in i have all these lists of complaints like da da da da da and this happened and that happened and he say yo man it s all cool though how bout we make a song and we just make song after song after song after song after song after song zane lowe he is the most cause i ve met him many times now and he is just so tapped into the joy of making music and he so gets it in the sense that it s like kinda let it lead you let the song sorta lead you to where it needs to go is the vibe i get from him like yea let s just see where this goes kanye west and yea that s what we did you know people think that our first two singles don t have drums but both of those are percussive instruments zane lowe yea totally that s what he s doing that s like dun dun dun dun dun dun that s what it is s i just wanna talk about working with him because i haven t actually seen too many people focus on that which surprises me maybe i m wrong but i just i love the idea of that collaboration occurring and it s a natural one certainly on fourfiveseconds i think that s one of rihanna s greatest vocal performances period kanye west she was killing that right zane lowe my gosh man i mean that s like a whole other attitude that i haven t heard from her as a star she s really gone inside that record and wrangled it how was it making that and getting that song out cause it feels effortless to listen to it almost has like a s fm american rock sort of country rock radio vibe to it you know what i mean like something you would ve heard in los angeles in or something kanye west i mean i liked i liked songs like that when i was growing up and i mean the type of chord changes that paul does i don t need to understand them and to be able to be involved with that zane lowe it s because he invented them kanye west yea exactly and be able to be involved with writing a song like that it s just like way next to like meeting paul mccartney is like meeting ralph lauren zane lowe yea totally kanye west it s like whoa zane lowe dude he s the greatest kanye west the greatest of their field period of all time zane lowe and you got to say wildin in a song with him it s just incredible cause it s still hip hop that s what s amazing about it kanye west yea the whole cadence was trap soon as paul starts playing i start singing in trap zane lowe that s again is the fusion of cultures which i love it s what did you call it before when you when you were talking about sean wearing and your shoes you were saying it s i can t remember what you said kanye west fusion is the future period the mixing of ideas the mixing of know the two lunch tables working together you know humanity period man we re one people and maybe that s like incorrect english i m sorry mom but you know i went to louise wilson s memorial you know the greatest fashion instructor of all time and i m talking about of all timers zane lowe educate us man tell us kanye west ok so louise wilson was the baddest professor of all time of any fashion school ever notorious for not letting people stop at a or a pushing people to a so the first time that i saw one of her students pheobe philo's c line collection i was looking at a when i saw mcqueen s last show the atlantis collection i was looking at a christopher kane's bandage collection i m looking at a alber elbaz i m looking at a that s the designer the designer of lanvin which completely revolutionized the men s sneaker fashion sneaker industry last time i saw her we had dinner at hakkasan which is my favourite restaurant in london and i think she knew that she was gonna pass and she just wanted to give me some words of advice moving forward and she was asking me about my daughter asking me about my wife and she said so many students they don t give it their all and the problem is soon as they do anything halfway good when they re years old years old their parents clap zane lowe clapping kanye west exactly that s what she said they clap and she just looked at me she said kanye don t clap zane lowe aww what that s just how you getting on with that kanye west i didn t know we were gonna lose her you know i just um and she told me she said you know thank you for the times you know when we came to performances and this has like really meant a lot to me you know she would zane lowe wanna take a minute we ll take a minute let s take a minute kanye west that s never happened to me in an interview before zane lowe you ok kanye west yea i m ok i think i m ok zane lowe we re gonna change the subject here we go one of the things you said recently which really kinda made me think was you know you really truly believe that you re gonna be the head of the world s first trillion dollar company and the first thing that sprang to my mind kanye was what is that company going to look like kanye west johnny ive who is like in my opinion from what i know elon musk included is like the world s greatest living designer and has the best mentality behind design and i said from what i know because there might be other there might be some others there are a lot that are great but johnny ive's the best that i know he said that people are so concerned at being first as opposed to being better so i think that i think innovation almost gets too much credit in a way so if we talk about this type of company it wouldn t be a company of innovation because as steve stoute told me driving down the westside highway there s no money in the innovation zane lowe yea and he s got a point kanye west the money s in the repetition you know so zane lowe it s in the quality kanye west and making something of better quality for more people so it has to be a balance of both i ve said this a few times but i wanna just say it right here for people who haven t read it or seen but i think people think that i pander to fashion particularly you know because people say why fashion it s not politics world war it s not that it s fashion it s just a jacket or something it s just a dress but i believe that the world can only be saved through design and i think that the fashion world has and when i say through design i know it s some snarky classist editor that s gonna take that and say kanye west said that the world will be saved with a couture dress that s not what i m saying the mentality behind design you know art is to be free design is to fix zane lowe this is important you re talking about the actual like you say the mentality the purpose behind it what it means behind the actual product kanye west no politics just truth does it fucking work or not irrigation you know that s a form of design zane lowe what are those conversations like because you one of the great privileges that you re in because you know you push yourself is that you get to find yourself in rooms with people that push themselves so that conversations can be pushed and i wonder what those conversations are like because i m fascinated by somebody like elon musk and his absolute inability to be restrained by boundary and you are very much cut from that same cloth what is it like when you guys get together and do you talk about things as kind of obvious or as what the future will feel like or is it more casual than that kanye west that s exactly what we talk about what does kanye west and elon musk talk about the fut zane lowe the fut tm kanye west so when i put out things that if i say hey i want to work with miucca prada one day on highschool uniforms or something i just put it out you know we just put it out there or as i told obama last time i saw him hey i want i would suggest that you sit with elon musk i would suggest that both you guys go to china i would suggest this the i think it may happen zane lowe must be amazing those conversations man must be amazing kanye west i got scared of the idea you know someone call you crazy so many times you start to believe it and i almost got scared of the idea of like going crazy in some way but i wasn t going crazy i was like the only person that wasn t crazy you know what i m saying like i just stand there and i just look like is anyone else here seeing what i m seeing none of you guys are seeing what i m seeing or it s just like your maybach and your house is like that important that you won t move at all zane lowe it s distractions kanye west that you won t say anything at all in risk of losing something you won t say anything on anyone s behalf at this point you know so if you have that ability to do that to see that you know that walt disney ability in some way you have to apply it you have to use it you can t be psyched out you know everyone s on our side i was just in my own way but everyone s on our side and everything that i ever said will happen will happen just as much as you guys saw that adidas original yeezys season presentation streamed to locations and you saw that front row the juxtaposition of the people in the front and second rows to where the people standing in the show had come from is the fusion and is the future it is the glass shattering of the class system which is the new racism class is the new way to discriminate against people to hold people down to hold people in a place based on where their kids go to school how much money they make what they drive where they live and what type of clothes they have and how much you know how much they have in their account for their retirement to somehow say that this person right here means more than this person like i know i tweeted black lives matter but all lives matter like my doorman is more important to me than any head of any company he keeps us safe my driver keeps us safe and goes to work every day the guy painting the windows at the house when we changed them from white to chocolate brown you know what the architect suggested he is just as important as anyone else that walks in that house and grabs a glass of champagne it s no more of this separation of what you came from your race financial background education talent level beauty whatever it is that people use to separate people zane lowe but was that moment which i didn t want to talk about but you raised it and i want to actually bring this up because you have to learn from experience you can t have all those answers straight away you have to make those mistakes yourself i think in order to come to that level of clarity kanye west and i m not saying i have answers i m just saying these are my current opinions as i gave my current opinions a year ago this is my current opinions now zane lowe sure sure and that s great that s what we want that s why i m asking questions so we get to hear your answers but when you i think cause you know i was nominated for that album of the year as well as part of the sam smith album as a producer and a co writer kanye west oh oh wow zane lowe right so i was at the awards ceremony with the other producers and co writers that are part of each records and like i m a huge fan of all the nominees that were nominated and i m a huge fan of beck and it s funny that you say you talk about everyone you want to get it to a place where people can exist in their own terms and that leaves it open for fusion but then like you say you can just push a button and be back and be old ye you know old yeezy is that what happened that night just gaaah i can t take it i ve gotta get up on this stage i ve gotta wild out cause we all thought you were joking you know what i thought was brilliant about that night when you did it on the night i was applauding because i was like that was sun tzu that was art of war he waited for the right platform went up pretended to do it walked back down everyone s like aww so funny i was like he just got the last laugh on this and then i woke up the next morning and it was like naw he s not an artist and i was like aw man i love that album kanye west yea i never said that he s not an artist zane lowe ok i m misquoting you but you were talking about artistry and do you learn form those lessons yourself is that when you kind of get a little bit closer to understanding what you believe is really important when you do things like and think well maybe i did kinda misconstrue that kanye west i think yea i misconstrued it but i think that everybody has a right to an opinion everyone has a right to be wrong you know there could be a lot of people who feel marshawn lynch shoulda been handed the ball but there s a bunch of patriots fans that are happy he didn t get the ball and everyone has a right to their opinion you know and i expressed my opinion and i ll take the weight of it zane lowe he s great though you know he is great though there s three kanye west naw you know as i said on the charlamagne interview when i was ironically having dinner with taylor swift the beck song starts playing and i was like this is really good maybe i might ve been wrong you know like and uh zane lowe it s a great album man kanye west and i hadn t been in like years and the grammy s are definitely like an ex girlfriend soon as you get in a car with them you wanna go right back home zane lowe so we re gonna get a record this year and i m excited to hear it i really am excited to hear it and as we draw closer to the end of this particular talk i want to do it once again bring it back to like the thing that really kanye west only one thing i want to say people say i m a hypocrite right zane lowe some kanye west people say that right zane lowe some kanye west yes i am i m a human being i m super hypocritical i can feel something one time and completely a different way another time i do it in the design office i do it in the studio i m super hypo i really love this i do it when i get dressed i love this tsk tsk i hate this zane lowe how long does it take you to get dressed on a daily basis kanye west minutes minutes bars zane lowe how long does it take your wife to get dressed every day kanye west sometimes minutes sometimes longer i mean she s a woman zane lowe course you know it seems that um you know what i love about only one is the interaction and the way that you ve been able to create different generations of your life and of your family communicating with one another through one another as a portal and i love that and i think it s one of those songs that successfully does that and um i m a father you re a father it s the greatest thing of all time no question about it it is the great level of all time it s the greatest thing of all time and you know your daughter is what months now months old you an only child kanye west yes zane lowe do you think about giving her brothers and sisters do you think about your upbringing and what you went through and how you feel in this life and what it means to have siblings kanye west oh i m practicing really hard i try as many times a day as i can nori this one is for you you need a sibling zane lowe for all the good ones and all the ones where everyone s like totally engaged with everything you re saying for right or for wrong or whatever i think you ve got it totally sussed i think you know you absolutely know that you ve talked recently about being the villain like how you know everyone wants the villain and everyone does well when the villain opens his mouth kinda thing but then at the end of the day you can go on another interview and you can show a really softer side and a very understanding and very human side that people who know you will tell me you totally are and it s so funny it goes from like boooo to like yeaaaa to like boooo to like yeaaaa and it s like i think you ve got it sussed i think you know what s going on all the time with all of this kanye west you win some games and you lose some zane lowe you win or you learn right kanye west yea you win or you learn bam there s a jewel i ll take that one with me zane lowe right on quote book so album this year sneak attack no doubt no question sneak attack s coming and um and there was a leaked poster that came out as well you gonna tour with rihanna is that out there now has that been confirmed or not confirmed or what the story with that it kanye west i don t believe i m supposed to confirm or not confirm zane lowe so that s happening i ve been long enough in the tooth to know what that means um but needless to say you re excited about returning to the stage in some capacity this year and we re looking forward to new music this year kanye west yea and i been doing a few performances since doing the snl performance did a couple performances out here and of course gonna do the brits i ve been really liking these performances i feel like these are like the performance version of that you know drake you know of the god album of the you know if you re reading this it s too late i feel like i m a visual extension of what he s doing like sonically zane lowe can we talk about drake for a second cause he s just to me he s the monster at the moment out there kanye west you know that shit is good yo zane lowe dude pm in new york that moment when he s like opening up and telling the truth about how he feels about his detractors and he s just basically just opening up what s going on is my real honesty not guarding himself or hiding away with any bravado or anything just like you know they scream my weaknesses and whisper my accomplishments like pffff i mean that moment for me is just like that s what i mean i love that about him that he s totally open in the sense kanye west i mean yea that element is great there s a lot of people that can t rap that can do that but the main thing is that fact that he s delivering you know a level of product as i said last interview i m a product guy and he s delivering a level of product to humanity that is of high quality it works of the time works all the time zane lowe that doesn t make sense kanye west haha but it works it works you know what i m saying and you have to it works that s it and i was just thinking like i don t have any advice for this young man but what i can say is run fly go as fast as you can don t stop and you know any time i can be of any service advice you know a beat verse you know whatever you need you need some confidential design advice with the shoes you doing over at the other company i m not supposed to say that you know anything that we can collectively do to deliver more awesomeness to the world as a team you know not just me and him us all zane lowe thanks man i always love talking with you bro i really do alright we re good kanye west got some vibes bars zane lowe bars kanye west more bars i am kanye west and that feels really great especially to say this year i came here to present my new video but before

expression of our now our fame right now us on the inside of the tv you know just to put the audacity to put anna wintour right next to donald trump i mean like i put ray j in there bruh this is fame bro like i see you amber my wife is a g not a lot of people's wives would let 'em say that we came over in the same boat now we all in the same bed well maybe different boats but you know if you think

institute last year and one kid came up to me and said three of my friends died and i don't know if i'm gonna be the next and it has to you know you have to think like you know when you're a senior and it's like the last month and you just don't feel like doing anymore work if you feel like you're seeing people dying right next to you you might feel like what's the point you know like life could be like start to feel worthless in a way i know times for me i sit down and talk to older rich people you know aka white and uh they tell me don't compare yourself to steve jobs don't compare yourself to walt disney and my friend sekaya told me ayy bruh bruh they tell me don't compare yourself to these people right my friend sekaya told me it's three keys to keeping people impoverished taking away

know he's going to wild out i know he's going to do something crazy everbody wanted to know what i would do if i didn't win i guess we'll never know i don't even know what he said i just know that the grammys if they want real artists to keep coming back they need to stop playing with us we ain't finna play with them no more flawless beyonc video and beck needs to respect artistry and he should've given his award to beyonc and at this point we're tired of it because what happens is when you keep on diminishing art and not respecting the craft and smacking people in their face after they deliver monumental feats of music you're disrespectful to inspiration we as musicians have to inspire people who go to work every day and they listen to that beyonc album and they feel like it takes them to another place then they do this whole promotional event they'll run the music over somebody s speech the artist because they want commercial advertising like no we not playing with them no more by the way i got my wife i got my daughter and i got my clothing line so i'm not going to do nothing to put my daughter at risk but i am here to fight for creativity that's the reason why i didn t say

robocop street lights bad news see you in my nightmares coldest winter pinocchio story standard edition cover exclusive edition cover i like that because i thought you're on the way to doing things differently all the promotion around your album it was really like just awesome to me because it wasn't the traditional roll out that they do to radio where they send the single and then they're doing is they're doing that and you know you're doing an appearance on you know whatever tv show but it was really cool it was like when you showed in over cities you showed the you know i wouldn't even call them videos it was more of like a just an art exhibition that you did in these different cities it is kind of what's spurred that to do it that way i mean we have dreams we wake up and we make them happen i appreciate that my label allowed me to go unorthodox with that and there's people at the label who appreciate it and there's people who don't appreciate that it's like non traditional in that way but i have to push and really it's all practice to me being a musician is practice life is practice you know so it's not like a in go so i'm fine to make a mistake i'm fine to like put out an auto tune album that no one understands i'm fine to put out a complete punk new wave album that no one understands i'm not trying to maintain you know some spot in the hip hop charts on radio or something like that i'm trying to open up people's minds i want people to think more i want people to feel like it's okay to create i want people to feel like it's okay to make mistakes in front of people and follow what their dreams are and not feel boxed in i want people to feel like you know awesome is possible i want them to you know feel like you know it's not a matter of just even what i'm doing at donda it's the amount of people that are hearing me and now they're going to fight to get the best ideas out because the world will only be saved through good intention and design it's not going to be saved is politics the irony is what holds things back politics so how could that push things forward i heard you say that you were trying to work out a deal with the gap and politics held you back from doing that with your merchandise for the tour and it may be just wonder what sort of elaborate on that what are you talking about when you say politics i mean it like what would happen if i was able to design a collection and was like backed by the gap it would be awesome right it would totally be awesome but then my question for you is but you have you're not hurting you're doing well so couldn't you just do that yourself you don't need the gap no you can't you need the infrastructure it's not a matter of just having money but you have a great staff set up in everything i feel like no i don't have a great staff at all that is a skill set that takes years and years of anything if i wanted to get into the coal business and i had and also well off is that that is what's the word i'm looking for i'm trying to use the simplest word sometimes yeah it's all relative because i'm not because okay i could make an amount that seems like really crazy to people like million a year right to open up a new fashion company might costs million so if i went and took all the money i had and i invested it into trying to do it like that it could leave me million in debt that's fair enough i get that and then you're not well off that's yeah i'm sorry i know it's not all about money but i've just been saying that the team that you have at donda and i would think that you could hire anybody that may want to come and work for you i'll now we are because of what we're doing because of the way we're turning up now we can get real designers real infrastructure but it's really hard just as much as you know getting a creative person is hard it's hard to get the back office guys the people that run the is a great designer i love saint laurent and their million dollar jackets and everything i love it but i should have backing from one in the majors louis vuitton group which is bernard arnault karen group which is france rapinoe or renzo rosso who owns diesel and margiela bottom line and that's the only way it's going to be because the thing is when you try to go you know when you go less that the level of the product is just isn't where should be yeah i'm doing t shirts that are amazing we put all our design into it and so many people like t shirts and i love that i get people t shirts but i also want to create entire gyms like gyms like i want to make a gym i wanna make a store i want to do apartment complexes i want to build cities i want to be involved with hyperloop when it comes to reality with eli musk that's the conversation i want to be in so i will not be held into a box of being a musician or that you get it somehow confused i don't look like a rapper now rappers look like me but when i started i wasn't gangsta enough you know what i'm saying like i'm getting married to kim kardashian and i've never played in the nba laughter michelle oh my god so that's thought you know you raise a really good point here if you just joined us i'm michelle and we're live on radio los angeles with kanye west you know in creativity in rap music do you think that because i don't you definitely don't do things like everybody else do you think there's a certain lack of originality and creativity not you know i'm not going to say that for all rap but it seems like you do things a little differently and a love that that with music i mean there's a lack of creativity in every field because people are afraid because the powers control people and the only place where people can be fully creative is in silicon valley everything else there's an old regime and oligarchs are controlling whether or not you're going to be able to feed your kids so no one can say the type of stuff that i'm saying because they'll lose their job there is a a lack in creativity in hollywood there's a lack in creativity in clothing there's a lack creativity in the education system there's a lack in creativity on the globe period hen you look up and look at billboard ads the majority of them suck there's a lack creativity in advertising in agencies there's just a lack because the person with the good idea needs to pay dues for years before their positioned to say the idea and they might not have the relevancy anymore right now i have the relevancy and i have the perspective and i have the voice and i'm going to scream as loud as i can and ain't nothing gon' happen to me except success you're here to save it man at least like change it which i love whoo that heat i love that there's so much passion because i share a lot of the same where the view is my passion and i feel like people don't always get it you know and they're like gosh it's kind of harsh with everyone you've just got to be true to yourself you know i got to by the way before i forget you know with your clothing and your fashion we were just talking about your merch line really quick and don't forget your question please i wanna stop using the term fashion because eve made adam bite an apple and since then it's been illegal to be naked i'm helping people follow the law in style i'm helping people with their opinion on how to follow the law this isn't about fashion i'm creating new standards things so you don't have to think about it fashion is too high of a skill set it just needs to be easy easy as the hoodie and jeans that i'm wearing and i'll do all the hard work i'll figure out exactly where that collar goes and exactly where that hoodie sits and and how many times you can wash that fabric and stuff so that it looks better years from now i'll do the hard work for you fashion is forcing people to do all this hard work where you look back years from now and say that looked crazy there are certain things that are just standard a suit jacket is a suit jacket is a suit jacket a hoodie is a hoodie is a hoodie jeans are jeans are jeans and a michael jordan sneaker is a michael jordan sneaker now let's take our kids to the park it's not about fashion it's about life and me helping it become more awesome to be continued with the breach of three levees protecting new orleans the landscape of the city has changed dramatically tragically and perhaps irreversibly there is now over twenty five feet of water where there was once city streets and thriving neighbourhoods i hate the way they portray us in the media if you see a black family it says they re looting if you see a white family it says they re looking for food and you know it s been five days because most of the people are black and even for me to complain about i would be a hypocrite because i ve tried to turn away from the tv because it s too hard to watch i ve even been shopping before even giving a donation so now i m calling my business manager right now to see what s what is the biggest amount i can give and and just to imagine if i was if i was down there and those are those are my people down there so anybody out there that wants to do anything that we can help with with the setup the way america is set up to help the uh the uh the poor the the black people the uh the less well off as slow as possible i mean this is red cross is doing everything they can we we already realize a lot of the people that could help are at war right now fighting another way and they ve they ve given them permission to go down and shoot us and subtle and but in even many ways more profoundly devastating is the lasting damage to the survivors will to rebuild and remain in the area the destruction of the spirit of the people of southern louisiana and mississippi may end up being the most tragic loss of all george bush doesn t care about black people why everything that's supposed to be bad make me feel so good everything they told me not to is exactly what i would man i tried to stop man i tried the best i could but you make me smile what's your addiction is it money is it girls is it weed i've been afflicted by not one not two but all three she's got the same thing about me but more about us she's coming over so i guess that means i'm her drugs just let me peek now i mean damn i'm so curious she's got a lover so the lies and the

shorty with a demo like hey you might like this and see he remind me of me just a year ago now he tellin' me i'm his her ro oh i took his cd and asked him what he's lookin' for he said man i don't

minds that wanna hold you down and in his time when you get with we'll be not far behind if you listen to the sermons and ask the lord for guidance you will see the many blessings blessings you have

stay out the clubs where the police and warrants be cause that will lead to prison where the inmates and wardens be but a lot of times we follow them when we know we ought to leave and stay up in the party when we know that we ought to leave but the women be callin' me the liquor be callin' me and what's the sense in cons tippin' strippers named diamond if he gonna be conflicted no different than diamonds and the lord is the only one that he can confide in so i don't know how you think that you could deny him i open up the book and the message is clear but i still be in the hood so the pressure is there to grab at that fast money just to get out of queens to bag up the work that they give out to fiends but that ain't gonna work if i say what i mean cause at the end of the day i'm trying to get out my dreams there must be more good women than men percentage wise so her chance of having a husband just minimized that's why a lot of girls claim they ain't into guys and mess with other girls part time to improvise i knew she wasn t bi no i seen it in her eyes but i'm like any other guy trying to get in her thighs she telling me about how black people should enterprise and i'm

tell me everything is going to be alright cause until the day a real man stands up i'm going to have to improvise was it something i did wrong yeah i know i'm wrong she's at home alone and i'm always

live and live http www schaulager org smq files lynching tree jpg this performance features a clear example of using symbolism to enrich the message of the song blood on the leaves tells the story of a relationship torn apart by materialism unprotected sex and drugs west samples nina simone's rendition of 'strange fruit' a song that paints a vivid picture of racial violence in the segregated south west samples the line black bodies swinging from the summer breeze strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees the frenzied pitched up use of this line cast the song in a racial light the characters in 'blood on the leaves' become the lynched victims in 'strange fruit' instead of racial violence these characters have fallen victim to the perils of materialism drugs and unprotected sex all of which are issues that disproportionately affect the black community west performed this song already saturated with meaning at the vma awards in front of a purposefully lighted and positioned backdrop of a photo by film director steven mcqueen the photo depicts a tree in new orleans that was the site of racially charged lynchings it s lit and positioned in such a way that as west performs in front of it he appears as a shadow his erratic movements almost resembling a man hanging from the branches the shadows of the audience s raised hands appear at the bottom of the frame as if coming out of the ground representing the scores of victims buried at sites like this across america http divaartist com divablog wp content uploads screenshot jpg after the performance west posted a picture of the

i m going to grab the camera that just happens and you don t expect that to happen with a celebrity cause you think they re like a museum animal and stuff but it s like don t shoot the animals then maybe i don t know what s interesting though the problem is that once you do something like that the word s out and these guys know that a shot of you losing your temper is worth ten times more then a shot of you remaining calm so it s kind of a no win situation a little bit well except for the fact that i m going to do something about it you know i m going to make a change i think it s my responsibility my mom she got arrested for being in the sit ins at age my grandfather drove the first car at the marches leaving out of oklahoma my father was an activist so i think they just like

as a nigga has a crib they want to break into that nigga crib see where he live see what he did and don't wanna do the same shit he did to get that crib get it you know when niggas is killin' niggas what's amazin' to me what don't phase me is when niggas try to call me crazy cause they don't phase me cause i don't give a fuck what people think cause people don't think see i don't give a fuck what people think cause people just don't think now picture this now if i show up onto this motherfucker and express myself creatively they always want to say he's crazy see and when they so distressed what would be the best thing to write how 'bout this kanye west wears a dress yes now maybe that can take away from the way i kick them niggas ass on maybe that can take away nah nah nigga they seen it these niggas seen it theyself well and my grandfather ninety seven he said i ain't never seen you get down like that he ain't give a fuck about the kilt this dress whatever the fuck they call it you see niggas killin' niggas you can't see through the fog with all the negativity that they write on a blog i give a fuck about what somebody think if that person doesn't think it's too early in the conversation anyway you know they say you should be embarrassed you should be embarrassed you a nigga how the fuck you gonna show your clothin' line in paris you should be embarrassed you should be didn't you read the reviews the press i don't give a fuck i guess i don't give a fuck no it's not that i don't give a fuck it's that i give most of the fuck and i'm not givin' up and it's not that i'm crazy no that's a lie i'm not crazy i'm just not satisfied and i would die for what i believe in when i see that uh just a change what y'all receivin' do you all receive us do y'all believe it it's too much okay there's someone they can't touch how 'bout some integrity from your favorite celebrity that's me that's me niggas killin' niggas why he do that why he wear that why he say that where he play it oh my god nigga niggas it's bad enough it's hard enough it's hard enough it's hard enough it's hard enough it's hard enough it's hard enough but you can never say i didn't give my heart enough and if we did somethin' good and we didn't say oh excuse me pardon us then they want to throw niggas back on on on the retarded bus and when they riot in the streets they gon' say what what the fuck started us and made 'em start it up and look at me like i ain't smart enough and everybody got a suggestion and a lesson and a question and a stress and then they always want to stress a man uh and say maybe he's too aggressive or uh well maybe the shit you doin' is just not impressive to a nigga so let me make this clear it won't be long 'til y'alls get more of what y'all gettin' right here no i ain't talkin' 'bout nobody comin' to atlantic city talkin' 'bout oh it's just a casino show or it's just new years so we can't do nothin' really creative no i'm talkin' about a motherfucker workin' every day from four o'clock in this buildin' readjustin' all these fuckin' cameras to make this show better and better better every night for y'all and all they can say he got a mask on he crazy but they just tryin' to fuckin' deter you from what you are seein' in front of you this is jesus walks this is can't tell me nothing i'm not crazy i'm just not satisfied so maybe let this time open up your mind and let you know that you can do anythin' in life yeah baby you can shine this right here lets you know you can do anythin' in life with enough time and focus and focus and time and time and don't let nobody tell you cause ain't nobody fuckin' with my clique when i look around they don't do it like my clique when i look around they don't do it like my clique when i look around they don't do it like my clique so here since they'll probably put this online let me make this shit real clear michael jackson died from a lack of information from motherfuckers bein' around him lyin' to him actin' like shit okay but i'm a find the information don't believe nothin' that they say don't matter who you look up to don't take more than ninety percent of what the fuck they say cause they are not you and that extra ten percent is what makes you you so you do what the fuck you want to do and if somebody tell you you can't do it be like man who the fuck are you you only got one life that you know about you only got and time is somethin' you can never get back most important thing don't forget that time is somethin' that you never can get back so don't forgot that cause the money could go and you could spend it over and over and over and over over over oh and the cars could crash and now did that tell me what do you have and the house can burn down and whose your real friends when you turn around yeah that's your clique clique clique clique clique ain't nobody fresher than my motherfuckin' clique clique clique clique clique as i look around they don't do like my clique clique clique clique clique and all these bad ladies mouloud achour i always wondered when we were talking with jean he was saying that it was hard for you to get into this fashion world and you were saying it was hard for michael jackson to put his videos on mtv and i don't realise how much a guy like you that i listen to everyday i watch everyday and influences the use everytime you do something people wanna do it so how is it possible that the big houses don't understand that kanye the thought was that everything popular was very basic and not complex and the negative connotation of commercial so soon as you're commercial you don't have the complexity of a bach a mozart a basquiat and if you say out loud as a commercial person that you're in the same breath as basquiat then everyone looks at you like you're an egomaniac or something but then you'll be like wait a second you know i was a gifted artist since age and like in national competitions and went to art school i'm actually getting an honorary doctorate on may th from the art institute of chicago so it was a great wall to break down but also what's fun about playing in the pop field versus the art field is you get a lot of exposure and the majority of the pop artists don't have the same responsibility to the sensibility so it's easy to slam dunk them to hit that brit awards performance super hard against everything else that's going on and but i want all the best for all of the pop stars i want all of us to have as inspiring of performances as possible i think it's important you know our point of references we need to study fellini and jodorowsky corbusier and the different information that i've got from living out here with paris hanging out with jean and going to the french flea market and everything that constant information education education is the power uhh can the headphones go louder kanye west yup swag king cole yup dj khaled can't a young nigga get money any more tell peta my mink is dragging

finally got it right and i've been partying with this one girl who claim i gotta go to work tomorrow but tonight's the night so pour another glass of that good stuff a couple more shots and i'll be doing fine i appreciate everyone s support for my clothing line but i wanted to clarify a few things the name of the line is kanye west not dw the dw was a design element placed on the invite in homage to my mom i really appreciate the fake dw twitter page but since it s not official i can t co sign any information on it simplicity is the ultimate sophistication leonardo da vinci more clarity i have no agency representing me currently william morris was fired after cara lewis quit i love cara lewis i love being back at my fashion office learning and creating it s so challenging and fun and i m surrounded by amazing people they say you only live once but every time i come to work i feel like i m starting a second life you guys might think i have some type of backing for my line but i don t i did the first fashion show out of my own pocket and used the money i made touring to follow my passion i ve been working at this for years now from the first offers to do urban clothing lines that i turned down to begging bape to do my line and never making any real headway to having an office in la that was shut down after the mtv moment along with my tour with lady gaga i moved to japan for one month after that and designed every night in my room i had this opportunity to intern at fendi and was also offered a position at versace which i could not take due to my contract with lv which was for years i moved to rome after i left japan and worked at fendi for months undercover i was there to give ideas for the men s collection i snuck to giuseppe zanotti s factory still under contract and learned to design womens shoes for years before my first show in paris after doing the first lv collection i was sure i would get a second shot to create but was never given the opportunity i designed a sneaker called the air yeezy with nike i m allowed to design pair of sneakers every years i have more ideas early i moved to paris and opened a small design studio the language barrier was quite difficult i still don t have a paris vat number to this day i don t know what a vat is but every time i asked why we didn t have fabrics they said it was because of the vat in paris i met many great people in design including the master azzedine alaia azzedine even came by my studio one day this was the greatest feeling to stand in his presence in my embarrassingly small paris studio in a courtyard opposite collate i remember being years old picking and my mother taking me with her shopping at the discount fur spots she said i would always point to the most expensive furs even as a child lol there is something about making clothing that always brings me back to that point for the first or years of my life the only thing i knew about women s clothing was what my mom would wear i guess some critics would joke that i still don t know anything lol my mom would wear blue jeans with a fur and an embellished cosby show sweater to pick me up from school the teachers said i couldn t focus i used to get kicked out of class for bringing dirty magazines and drawing nike s in th grade being a celebrity has afforded me many opportunities but has also boxed me in creatively i was just discussing becoming the creative director for the jetson movie and someone on the call yelled out you should do a jetsons tour this just happened a few hours ago i was very insulted of course because for anyone that s seen the watch the throne tour coachella glow in the dark or runaway know that i have real ideas i appreciate having the most nominations at the grammy s but i feel so conflicted by the fact that award shows sometimes are completely illogical good logic tells me smile kanye the world likes you again red or blue pill aaaaand swallow lol i wouldn t have the prestige i have if it wasn t partially for the grammy's validation and i honor that hmmmmm what to wear here i go again yeezy the trend setter or complete f cking fashion victim the verdict is still out this is just a train of thought but i figure it s better to read than trained thoughts what good is fame and prestige if you can t use it to help people i want to help by doing what i know how to do best create i have started a new company and i m so excited about the name it s got the best name ever of all companies of all time the name of the company is donda donda is a design company which will galvanize amazing thinkers and put them in a creative space to bounce there dreams and ideas i used to blog all the time an fit was a way to get my opinion out dr dre redesigned headphones and made more impact off of one product i am assembling a team of architects graphic designers directors musicians producers a rs writers publicist social media experts app guys managers car designers clothing designers djs video game designers publishers tech guys lawyers bankers nutritionists doctors scientists and teachers donda will be comprised of over divisions with a goal to make products and experiences that people want and can afford i want to put creatives in a room together with like minds that are all way doper than me we want to help simplify and aesthetically improve everything we see hear touch taste and feel to dream of create advertise and produce products driven equally by emotional want and utilitarian need to marry our wants and needs donda this will all take time but i wanted everyone s to know what i really care about i care about people i care about my fans i care about people who have never heard of me there are over billion people on the planet now it s something about coming from music that makes me so optimistic music travels and is not limited to only the wealthy sometimes my grammar is wrong but my thinking is right my mom was an english teacher so i know she sends an smdh from heaven am in london my dreams keep me woke the watch the throne tour was a small example of what a donda experience can be i m currently working on a new screen experience this is one of our projects to be released this year called olympics it s semi sci fi since is only years away we would also like to design the mtv awards we re taking everything steps at a time lol i wanted to put this in the world in hopes that the people who can actually make a difference will stand up and reach out we need as many amazing powerful smart talented wealthy people to be involved come get on board don t just sit there reach out we can collectively effect the world through design we need to pick up where steve jobs left off when i said wealthy i wanted to point out there are so many billionaires in the world that can come together and help to redesign it and help education school systems were designed to turn people into factory workers schools should be designed to prep human beings for real life spike jonze and i want to do a summer school that tries new forms of curriculum math classes should teach addition subtraction multiplication division accounting and money management aaaaaand cut unless you re a math major kids you should be able to take majors starting in grammar school like how it is at performing art schools instead of kicking kids out of schools for using their iphones why not promote it allow kids to use search engines to do test like the real world give kids the amount of test they would have in a year in one day but they have to get everything perfect please excuse my grammar i know it s extremely ironic some kids have better memories than others what about emotional iq s what about kids who do bad in school because of how bad their surroundings are excuse me i just get excited at the possibilities the more excited i get the more grammatical errors you ll see we need to take what michael jackson felt and mcqueen and steve jobs and we need make things better when me and jay toured every night i peered into the audience astonished by the different walks of life that came to support us the adrenaline is running i don t know if i can even get to sleep now from wall street to the london riots to chicago murders i sit everyday and ask what can i do to make a difference i know this is not a very rapper thing to say but i haven t bought a new car or piece of jewelry in about years i invest every dime back into creativity hiring amazing creatives paying for flights offices etc my area of expertise is in music my passion is in music design film and products my strength is connectivity there are so many broken systems from the economy to school systems to jail systems we need experts for this we need scientist and top world designers to directly affect governments i just wanted to share what s been on my mind if you have an apple and i have an apple and we exchange these apples then you and i will still each have one apple but if you have an

be a board of directors that goes through your tweets like when you have an idea you give them to kim and a bunch of people and they go okay you can tweet that or no you cannot tweet that do you think you should have a board of directors absolutely not no yeah everything you tweet you think have you regretted anything you ve tweeted nope nothing never you don t go maybe i should have thought about that a little longer what s the point of thinking what s the point of thinking well sometimes i understand but sometimes there is a point to thinking and then you tweeted out that you want mark zuckerberg to give you million in hindsight should of that have gone on facebook yes yes i could've put that on facebook now i understand why he didn t hit me back yeah i understand that zuckerberg doesn t use twitter yeah even though i have had dinner with him and his wife and told them about how i wanted to help the world and he said he d help me and then blah blah bla like and that s how it feels though you know it s like the pursuit of happiness like it s like you re trying to sell this bone density machine or something you know like in that movie i feel that if i had more resources i could help more people i have ideas that can make the human race existence within our years better period fuck the paparazzi whatever perception you have of me starting with the truth starting with starting with what everyone s thinking start there put some dope shit with it ok i m with you on 'ye is in the building put your motherfucking hands in the air right now put your hands in the air right now yeah okay i m with you on the truth part when you say put some dope shit with it give me one example the ideas 'cause maybe someone watching will give you the money we re in a renaissance period we re in a place where people are like multi disciplined artists like steve mcqueen that directed years a slave he was considered to just be a photographer but then he won an oscar we re not in a place where people can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life so the exact amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything i put into my music i put them into shoes and they worked you know people never write kanye s pissing everybody off they try to position that through the media in some way that i m like whatever whatever your friends might say you know i saw kanye how was he did he i care about people i care about my dad lived in homeless shelters less than five years ago to find out he s a psych major my mom was the first black female chair of the english department at chicago state university i was raised to do something to make a difference to take you know i didn t take the oscars as a joke it was funny you know what i m saying it was like the moment all black actors can talk about the glass ceilings that we ve dealt with out in this town and this is the moment you get your night go ahead chris rock is going to do it bam talk about how many times you ve been blocked from being able to excel i didn t take it as a joke it ain t no joke as rakim said it ain t no joke i used to let the mic smoke now i slam it and make sure it s broke that s what i was raised on rakim phife dawg hip hop expression hip hop started out in the park everybody s trying to i don t give a fuck how much you sold if you re playing on radio are you connecting picasso is dead steve jobs is dead walt disney is dead name somebody living that you can name in the same breath as them don t tell me about being likable we got years here we re one race the human race one civilization we re a blip in the existence of the universe and we constantly try to pull each other down not doing things to help each other that s my point it s like i m shaking talking about it i know it s daytime tv but i feel i can make a difference while i m here i feel that i can make things better through my skill set through my skills i m an artist five years old art school ph d art institute of chicago i am an artist i have a condition called synesthesia where i see sounds i see them everything that i sonically make is a painting i see it i see the importance i see the importance in the value of everyone being able to experience a more beautiful life when i make clothes it s funny because i ll sit there with obama and leo s talking about the environment and i m talking about clothes and everyone looks at me like that s not an important issue but i remember going to school in fifth grade and wanting to have a cool outfit i called the head of payless i m like i want to work with you i want to take all this information that i ve learned from sitting in all these fashion shows and knocking on all these doors and buying all these expensive clothes and i want to take away bullying you know i want to michael jackson and russell simmons is the reason i was able to go so far in music there was a time when michael jackson couldn t get his video on mtv because he was considered to be urban the michael jackson so i literally have to be michael jackson of apparel in order to break open the doors of everyone that will come after i m gone after i m dead after they call me wacko kanye isn t that so funny that people point fingers at the people who have influenced us the most they talk the most shit about the people who cared the most i m sorry daytime television i m sorry for the realness well it s not daytime television anymore we re going to take a break and we are going to come back we re going to play second rule which should be very fun with

la la laaaa now that you're tuned in i suggest you zoom in and claim puff dead i'm out the tomb then i'm married to the game like the bride and the groom is if you don't want to move then leave the room here see you the type of nigga believe the rumors but i'm the type to show y'all what the truth is and show you how the coupe is and you don't know where the roof is and the interior is stupid so i'mma shoot my shot and just do it cause i can't stop my love for the music been a decade since biggie dropped juicy when i think back sometimes i still lose it and feel the ambiance from the screams of the audience and y'all response i'mma give it everything i got just to stay on top for the love of the block cause it's still part of me and we from harlem we gonna give it everything i got just to stay on top for the love of the block cause it's still part of me and we from harlem we cause we can't stop and you don't stop cause you can't stop what's up rap world i figured i'd take this opportunity to look outside of myself and say what would i say if i was them heavy d mary j no more uptown bad boy on the way b i g 's in the door making hits junior m a f i a clique craig mack flava in ya ear don't stop there lil' kim posing in the panties and a brassiere sayin' biggie biggie give me one more chance biggie biggie give me one more chance ah man fly chicks rolling in fly whips bad boy invented the remix these hits got the whole world loving my clique they loving the sound the whole world hitting my hit big passed and he went up to heaven only on the second album he already a legend man i wish big could've seen the world in ' matter of fact sometimes i wish i just died with him i miss him he's still part of me fashion is obviously very important to you you re designing again in fashion tell me what s the difference in how you approach fashion to how you approach music is it similar is it completely different everything in the world is exactly the same alright great i don t think we re done but i think i m going to sign off meaning like you can do comparable people like who would you compare daniel day lewis or phillip seymour hoffman to musically or in fashion directing architecturally who was your favorite teacher when you were growing up it s certain people that when that teacher when you re in eighth grade that this person really cared and you knew this person cared about you as a student and gave everything they had and they were meant to do that it s other people that were just like getting a check or something it s all the same you know for me i give you paintings sonic paintings i have synesthesia i can see sound in front of me so when i want to do fashion i just want to give you sculptures so it s like michelangelo the church wanted him to paint and he just wanted to do sculptures so the hard the difficult thing for me that everyone doesn t understand i just want to be able to use marble and make sculptures but due to the fact that i m a celebrity all these different things they re like no you can t do this you have to do this kind of line so it s kind of the first of its kind so that s the reason why there s been a lot of confusion as to why i want to do it to why is he getting so frustrated about it it s like why don t you just do music it s an overall creative expression like i have a friend yves b har that designed the jawbone wristband and stuff and the jambox and everything as a designer you know he's not in a box to only design you know a speaker he can design whatever he wants and i'm like that's the type of creative expression and freedom any creative you know wants and as you know get really successful at one thing you start to grow and you're like you feel like you can do more things and your shoe starts to get a little bit tight and you do everything you can to get a bigger shoe so you can walk further and run faster and people are like now in this day and age if you don't believe it it's like they're like no kanye you can't run faster this is the limit that was made this is the walls that michael jackson broke down for you and jay z and russell simmons broke down for you this is the end of it so i'm in the process all of the controversy about why i'm in the process of breaking down walls that people will understand years from now years from now jamie fox featuring kanye west first verse last night me and my dogs was hanging out tired of being cramped up in the house we were simply celebrating life off from work today so it's all right but all those ups and downs turned me in a twist

more than to just get rich since when was making music about getting rich since when was making art about getting rich and i know it's easy for me to say cause having money's not anything and not having it is remind me again why we in this shit remind me again why the grammys couldn't suck my dick remind me again who's the original superfly and i got love for hov but i ain't fuckin' with that suit and tie remind me again remind me again why we in this shit every nigga tryin' get rich every rapper tryin' get rich and every rapper rap about fuckin' somebody else bitch remind me why we in

way i felt at that time and feelings was the only facts and racism and materialism is killing blacks and one more thing if i can ask one more thing if i can ask cause in this life our life just moves too fast and time is something you will never get back what's your quality of life what's your quality of life and that's why i mean it when i say i hope you have a good time tonight i hope you have a good time tonight london it's louise wilson's birthday tonight an inspiration not the lead instrument i'm the lead instrument happy birthday to louise who taught alexander mcqueen and kanye west even though she doesn't want me to put that on my resume but i just feel sometimes like there is no good ideas and no real ideas and nothing sincere left and everything's been so homogenized and it's all big business and there's no creativity when really we have the ability to have a union utopia if we just help each other if we just use our resources and stop trying to compete against each other and beat each other and eat each other and maybe come together and try to teach each other and reach each other and maybe try to come together and love each other love each other and love one another man the way you love your mother man the way you should love her man y'already understand cause this is our shit and this is our clique ain't nobody fresher than my motherfuckin' clique i said ain't

you got a closet full of minks chinchilla you got beats from kanye i got a bureau full of diamonds what else ya need i can change four times a day if i want to you even tryin' to eat lobster and drink champagne now you know that ain't your roots for you strictly a collard green and cornbread bit now you know if anybody know it i know but since you feel like that this evening sit down know what and drink some champagne with me and let me rap to you you'll never catch me in that baby momma benz again i'm pushin' a g all the girls sayin' that his hair look indian and ain't never seen him and mcm now i don't like fake boobies but i'd do it to lil' kim yes i would we gon' roll this weed we gon' play like sonny bono and hit these trees soon as we get alone i'm doin' beats for pro bono soon as we get to bone now she like a lot of clothes i like to see her out of 'em she got a lot exposed pump up the volume pump up the volume dance dance don't give kanye a chance 'cause i'm a gemini with two sides and two rides y'all talkin' business i'm peepin' her thighs look i'm tryin' to hit that back end 'fore i get that back in called trina and do she need that beat tracked again 'cause i came back for you to show you that i'm workin' with a little somethin' and we get the session pumpin' see i came back for you 'cause any rap chick that look half nice i'm givin' 'em half price back when eve went with steve before she had her weave i was sendin' beat tapes like you wouldn't believe back when foxy had a group with nas and az the way she looked on chyna doll i woulda did them beats for free

head sale send send headshots first though will you beat tapes for who oh trina oh i'm right there i'm right there i'll be the i'll be in studio in five minutes yo yo she said she want her ass look gushy wet i told her all i need is my back end check i told her to i ain't finish that verse so after walking through here i decided that i wanted to make sure for anyone that didn t have tickets tonight that you all could have tickets to the show so anybody who wants to come tonight you can have tickets for the entire office but i just wanted to tell you guys i really do believe that the world can be saved through design and everything needs to actually be architected and this is the reason why even some of the first donda employees were architects that started designing t shirts instead of buildings but just to see the work actually be actualized if i sit down and talk to oprah for hours the conversation is about realization self realization and actually seeing your creativity happen in front of you so the reason why i turn up so much in interviews is because i ve tasted what it means to create and be able to impact and affect in a positive way and i know that there s more creativity to happen and i know that there s traditionalists that hold back the good thoughts and there s people in offices that stop the creative people and are intimidated by actual good ideas i believe that utopia is actually possible but we re led by the least noble the least dignified the least tasteful the dumbest and the most political so in no way am i a politician i m usually at my best politically incorrect and very direct i really appreciate you guys willingness to learn and hone your craft and not be lazy about creation i m very inspired to be in this space tonight this show if you come see it um i m a bit self conscious because i m showing it to architects so the stage does have flaws in it it s an expression of emotion so give me a pass on that and that s basically all i have to say so thank you very much don t want nobody to die don t want to have to ride but in this game i guess that s just the way i guess that s just the way have it your way it s gonna be slow singing flower bringing gat clinging bat swinging bullets flyin niggas dyin mom s cryin faggots really don t want it lead coming blood gushin from ya arms legs head and stomach i felt the hatred cause when i turned around like the matrix comin for me an array of bullets headin dead for me first the one and then came the two and three and four five six seven shots from a mac platinum producer killed by haters tonight on channel he do beats for pac now coming out the spring from heaven ya know my piece is hotter than grease is with no wrong way to eat ya face like a reese s seem like the second i get some shine niggas quit they fuckin job so they can hate full time so gimme the gat i hit em wit that cock back blat blat let me tell you niggas something familiar broke niggas don t want war man i ll kill ya oh oh i get it this year niggas don t dance but just rock bulletproof hats and steel pants now everybody got a gun in they hand yeah bitch nigga run to ya man street sweeper aerials fuck where they land niggas close they eyes and don t aim like my bitch when she pop champagne bottles i tell you bout them damn models they can t cook for a lick but they ll lick a dick and swallow look i been living my life bullshittin when i write songs especially talkin bout havin ice on and i could barely keep my lights on niggas played me like ty son trying to take my light songs cuse they know i d knock niggas the fuck out the box full glocks the fuck out the box cocked who the fuck tryin to box right now i feel like my whole city on my back i feel like next

man stands up i'm going to have to improvise we re in a renaissance period we re in a place where people are multi disciplined artists like steve mcqueen who directed years a slave he was considered to just be a photographer but then he won an oscar we re not in a place where people can only have one career or one profession throughout their entire life so the exact amount of emotion and color palette and sonics and everything i put into my music i put them into shoes and they worked kanye s pissing everybody off they try to position that through the media in some way that i m like whatever whatever your friends might say i saw kanye how was he did he i care about people my dad lived in homeless shelters less than five years ago to find out he s a psych major my mom was the first black female chair of the english department at chicago state university i was raised to do something to make a difference you know i didn t take the oscars as a joke it was funny it was like the moment all black actors can talk about the glass ceilings that we ve dealt with out in this town and this is the moment you get your night go ahead chris rock is going to do it bam talk about how many times you ve been blocked from being able to excel i didn t take it as a joke it ain t no joke as rakim said it ain t no joke i used to let the mic smoke now i slam it and make sure it s broke that s what i was raised on rakim phife dawg hip hop expression hip hop started out in the park everybody s trying to i don t care how much you sold if you re playing on radio are you connecting picasso is dead steve jobs is dead walt disney is dead name somebody living that you can name in the same breath as them don t tell me about being likeable we got years here we re one race the human race one civilization we re a blip in the existence of the universe and we constantly try to pull each other down not doing things to help each other that s my point it s like i m shaking talking about it i know it s daytime tv but i feel i can make a difference while i m here i feel that i can make things better through my skill set i am an artist five years old art school ph d art institute of chicago i am an artist i have a condition called synesthesia where i see sounds i see them everything that i sonically make is a painting i see it i see the importance in the value of everyone being able to experience a more beautiful life when i make clothes it s funny because i ll sit there with obama and leo s talking about the environment and i m talking about clothes and everyone looks at me like that s not an important issue but i remember going to school in fifth grade and wanting to have a cool outfit i called the head of payless i m like i want to work with you i want to take all this information that i ve learned from sitting in all these fashion shows and knocking on all these doors and buying all these expensive clothes and i want to take away bullying michael jackson and russell simmons is the reason i was able to go so far in music there was a time when michael jackson couldn t get his video on mtv because he was considered to be urban the michael jackson so i literally have to be the michael jackson of apparel in order to break open the doors of everyone that will come after i m gone after i m dead after they call me wacko kanye isn t that so funny that people point fingers at the people who have influenced us the most they talk the most shit about the people who cared the most i m sorry daytime television i m sorry for the realness yeah yeah class

she'll be with you when she kiss you she'll be licking on my missile no homo see my logo and you'll hold shows like it's promo it's tight i had to force it now they call me porcelain cause i'm the shit yeah i'm the shit up in this bitch up in this bitch yeah i'm the shit yeah i'm the shit up in this bitch up in this bitch yeah i'm the shit yeah i'm the shit lou stoppard kanye west welcome to showstudio we're gonna be answering questions from some of your fans some of your friends some of your peers but the first question i wanna ask you it's actually from me so lou from london you're one of the most famous men in the world and i think everyone has an opinion about you i really noticed that as we were preparing for this interview everyone thinks they know you i've watched quite a lot of your interviews recently and you've really talked about this idea of not being heard there's quite an irony to that cause you have such a huge direct reach but i got the sense you've really felt you were not being listened to or not being understood do you think everyone fully understands kanye west or do you think you're very different to your public persona have you created that in some way kanye west yeah i think there's people who understand they see it that's the same people who see an earthquake coming on or see a tsunami coming i think there s people who don t want to embrace what it really is so they use their position of like class or snobbery or whatever comments they have to just try to always down things and to not give it its just due or just opportunity as a form of discrimination you know most people don't understand who they are so people's misunderstanding to me is a misunderstanding to themselves that they don't understand that he's not being the projected version of himself he's not what he was taught by current society or taught by this lifetime he's evoking something from another place and this is unfamiliar it's alien to us you know it's easier for us shun it than to really try to dig deeper and find out more about it it's funny that so many people that are supposed to be like so super educated love to just pick the lowest hanging fruit of a concept of fame or celebrity as a way to diminish or to take away the validation of what is being done up to this point and what will be done in the future ls talking about what you did in the past and what you want to do in the future a question that was submitted by one of you fans sam hollis he said what do you consider your greatest contribution to music but also your greatest contribution to creativity kw well i'm answering the second question first the greatest contribution to creativity is taking away the bullying well i'm sure that i've bullied myself sometimes but taking away people being able to bully you because you're a creative we're bullied and controlled by organisations and money and the people with money are in power and that's gonna change after me and kim's lifetime it's gonna go more back to when people used to philosophise and talk about proportions and shape and colour and what we can do for the next generations but right now it's all about what people can do to make the most money and how they can not cut in creatives in any profit and use creatives against themselves in a way like if they know someone is a genius but not business smart they take advantage of that so me constantly fighting that on the front line i think is the greatest thing i ve tried to open up so that creatives can be more empowered because i believe the world can be saved or helped and the world meaning us as human beings our civilisation us as a race as one race can be helped through allowing people with more positive motives who see more colours than just green to help be at least a part of the conversation and be heard and listened to what was the first question ls it was about your greatest contribution to music but maybe you don t think like that anymore kw yeah music synthesis just to synthesise to take mos def and bring him to the studio with jay z i think is the greatest when people say oh this is backpack or this is gangster or to go on tour with roc a fella with a chain and have people boo me and be like roc a fella is not hip hop and fight against that now it s considered to be one art form like what louise wilson would always talk about there s this juxtaposition high low these opposites and combining them this combination that makes a greater civilisation and a greater human being the actual human being a thousand years from now generally as a race we should be far advanced like at the beginning of prometheus like how that guy was just like chtchhhhhe noise he was like mike tyson meets steve jobs meets shakespeare as a person there was a time when people were working on multiple things and have multiple art forms and businesses and different things that they could do but now you re only supposed to be able to do one thing and in the future people will be highly skilled in a lot of things because they won t be afraid to fight for their education ls i think it makes people uncomfortable doesn't it when people try and kind of get themselves out of their box they see musicians as musicians and when you do fashion it makes people annetuate this relates to a question that came in from nick knight he runs showstudio who you collaborate with a lot he talks about your bravery he said you seem sort of be open to make very brave decisions and i think in some points that relates to pushing yourself into new arenas he gave examples like opening black skinhead with three black kkk hoods and not putting new slaves on youtube or appearing naked in the black skinhead video he's interested do these decisions feel brave at the time do you feel brave and maybe what's the bravest thing you've ever done kw i mean there's nothing to be afraid of really i don't ever wanna take to much credit for being brave that's just a responsibility of ours as artists to give our truth at time and it's just as simple as that soldiers are brave they have a serious responsibility to go fight for their countries police officers are brave fire fighters it's their responsibility to go into a fire and for the rest an artist's responsibility to give our truth i just think more than courage or bravery it's just i ls honesty kw yeah honesty maybe the answer didn't some answers i'm gonna give are not gonna make complete sense if you're a very literal by the book person you might find a flaw in the final finishing i suppose you understand the just of what i'm saying and you know the other day i came up with an equation that explains the way visionaries think i suppose to very calculated people as someone as you get and most people will say if you put and in front of me i'm gonna say well plus is five times is divided by is this and divided by is that and then come up with an average of all those things and then when you say blah blah blah that's the thing that people marvel at like wow that really was not what i was expecting or not what we wanted to put you in a box for but i felt i got something more out of it and that is the calculation of the zeitgeist because everything changes every day something changes people get so caught up in the embarrasment of changing their mind in front of someone and one thing can change everything so you have to put that as a part of your and you don't have to i have put it as a part of my and equation ls it's interesting you use the world visionary there a lot of our viewers they ask questions about that term and about the term 'creative genius' sam thompson he has this question where he said you've called yourself that and equated yourself to these different people da vinci walt disney steve jobs michaelangelo he asks how would you define a genius in that context but also why do you feel the need to call yourself that kw because otherwise i'm called celebrity i'm called nigger i'm called rapper and when they use the word celebrity nigger rapper isn't that in a positive way and all these things all these words can be used in an extremely positive way what's up my nigger you know but that's not the way it's used so i have to define who i am all of my aspirations are the things that currently only sixty year old white people do so i have to redefine and let people know exactly who i am and it's not letting them know by you know wearing a suit or letting them know by wearing a rolex or letting them know by bragging about how much money a sponsorship made on top of a rap it's letting them know by saying let's start with this i'm a creative genius laughs it's proven and now we'll continue to prove it when people try to take the piss out of me for clothing and this and that they never think about the fact that i've never had the opportunity to be properly educated and if given the meanings to be properly educated or given the proper support groups i would completely shhh light the lights up we sell shoes that people wanna line up for because we put love in them we put heart in them we want to make christmas presents we want to make something that people want so bad that it hurts them if they can't have it it not a it's not a just a financial oppertunity cause you need finances but it's a form of discrimination and racism especially with blacks and fashion and it literally you know it took me being kanye west to get this far in fashion meaning i was being able to become a multimiljonair and invest in myself because no one else would have i got this employee that's a black guy and there will be sometimes there will be a piece of misinformation three weeks later he'll tell me something and he says it kinda like with his voice down i remember being with my dad and my dad was the type of dad that would be everybody's dad a guy would come in and sell some cookies but my dad was a sellsman also so he's saying excuse me i got these cookies and he'd say yo sir pick your head up and explain to me what you wanna say and what you wanna sell this guy this employee because blacks especially in america have been raised with slave mentality don't feel they have the right to speak as loud as possible and everytime you hear a black person speaking as loud as possible it's after someone's gotta say look at this niggers over there so if you don't want to be called a name in a derogatory way you'd rather put it in what's people's favorite word to use for me humble but if we go on your iphone on a dictionary and look up the word humble eighty procent of the definition is negative it's a controlling word it's a way to control the masses and to control the sheep yeah i think there s a level of reality to being nice to being cordial to people but if you have the ability to lead you are a leader you have the answers or you have the ability to find people with the answers and your will is to help you should not be humble you should speak up because this world is broken so someone needs to say something and sometimes i just feel like the only one that's not crazy ls i want to ask you a question that's relatable to what you were saying the question came in quite a lot but it was posted particularly nicely by aravin sandran he's and from london and he said do you think the resistance and criticisms to your work is being partly because you're a black man would your ideas and work received differently if you were a white man kw if i was a white man that became a really successful musician that box would have put me in a chamber that would have said that i shouldn t work so there s a lot of white people that if they re really super good at something they also get discriminated against in another field you could be a photographer and someone would say you can t be an artist you could be a designer and someone would say you can t be a musician or someone would say you can t be a film director as far as the advantages in life yes if you are born white you have that on your gene pool currently because the world is controlled by whites you have that as a as an advantage and if you add a couple of other things to it you have a very high chance of success whereas because the world is run by whites currently if you re born black if you make it to something like the met ball or the grammys most likely you ve done ten times the amount of everyone else there to get there ls it's interesting simon foxton who's a stylist i know you know his work asks the question that relates as well he said your clothing line has been greeted with a lot of harsh criticism do you reflect like a lot of designers do where they take that criticism and they use it to kind of develop their aesthetic and change their work so do you do that or does it just make you even more convinced in your belief and vision kw yeah i m convinced that i know what i like and i know that i just know i know and i don t care i don t care because anyone that is criticising most likely they saw the s and acted like they didn t like them because they re racist and discriminatory they re not only racist against black people they discriminate against celebrity they discriminate against people with multiple art forms or they could say oh wait a second that cut wasn t that good but they do enough to throw a stab at oh that didn t fall the right way or that wasn t styled the right way but they didn t do the research on how difficult it was to one by one put together a design team and to fight against the idea of celebrity to get overcharged because you re a musician or people feel like you have money to get completely taxed by the fashion world and i love it because it s like going to harvard that s the reason why i m in fashion i think it s the ultimate training because i dropped out of art school eventually i got a phd this year like a honorary phd at the art institute of chicago i dropped out of that school and i wanted to go back to the school of hard knocks right now in all honesty you know whatever the fuck i m going to say today i m going to say it and i m just gonna fucking own it and that s how i feel right now if i feel differently in three years i ll tell you how i feel but right now the highest art form is actually fashion what s funny about that is people in art look down at fashion designers it s like a class i mean where s architecture the most energy currently is around fashion because with music it s in question if a song is popular if that person is really a good artist or not in fashion for the most part if someone is really popular it s because it s agreed upon that they re an amazing artist they re amazing at what they ve done people do the history on what their background is did they intern for christian lacroix did they work at margiela for a period they find out what the history is and see if that someone is making a connection to something that is current that s relative that is in touch and fashion designers are superstars currently too it feels like hip hop felt to me in the nineties it s like me i m a hip hop artist but it s like why are you going to the fashion world i mean it s just a really interesting art form it s just a different art form business is an art the way you talk to people is art an interview can be an art everything is a form of art i appreciate the critics because when i see the collection i just did and when i used the stretch french terry that i found in japan and i use on market canvas like heavyweight canvas and i put it in my colour palette and i see different tones come down together you know i ve created like a moving expressionist painting and that satisfies me so if someone was to go up to a monet and say this dot wasn t louis vuitton level it d be like what do you mean it s all an expressionist painting by the way you know we die years years years you know we will die but on that day i lived ls a question that came in from natalie wo it goes back to what you said about your dad your dad was in the black panthers and your last collection did have a very political undertone it was very much about racism kw wait a second is that a white person who said that ls i don t know her ethnicity kw i think it s racist when white people assume when a black person uses colour it s a political statement ls were you not making a political statement kw no it s a painting it s beautiful colours that statement is not gonna stop the murders in chicago that statement is not gonna help people get jobs that statement is not gonna take guns out of hands in atlanta that statement is not going to stop zimmerman from bragging about it s such a thing like i had this one stylist come up to me and virgil was standing next to me and said you need to watch out for him he s taking your place and i was like oh the one spot for the black guy at the dinner table in fashion that place is that what you re talking about so the assumption that my artistic expression of clothing has something to do with race or politics a more politically correct term ironically for racism is racist in itself ls a lot of fashion designers do see their work as political so maybe that s why people see your work as political or about social issues perhaps it s a compliment they want to read something into your work because they think it has depth and it matters it doesn t seem like you see it like that like mcqueen s work for example people saw it as political kw yeah i m not gonna let anyone score points on me if someone asks me about something i m gonna block all shots and i m not gonna take any free points i m not gonna have someone say oh i heard you knocked that guy out two weeks ago while this happened and i would be like oh yeah no if it wasn t my intention for it to be political and everyone gives it this credit and somehow they re giving it a credibility i m like well no i don t even want that kind of credit i don t want anything that i don t deserve i just want a chance to drink at the clear fountain i just want a clean shot i just want a clean bat to swing i want a clean bat to be able to swing at the ball with every one of these questions are gonna show the amount of dirt that s actually on the bat ls do you think it would be easier for you if you weren t famous then kw yeah being famous is like the n word people remind me at every meeting about how famous i am but somehow no it wouldn t be easier the answer is absolutely no you need fame in order to sell your shit that s why people pay for advertisers so i m basically the first of a celebrity that approached his entire career and life like he was an old bag brand that went and re did itself and went and got a really cool designer that anna wintour suggested to revitalise it and became a really big brand meaning like celebrities have always had a way that they were supposed to do business with licensing deals and this and this but i always approach myself in a luxury way whether it s calling nick knight a million times to work with him or going to factories in italy or begging tessiclub which hasn t called me back yet to use their fabrics because they do celine and lanvin i ve always fought just to have better paints to work with when i was in high school i was at this national competition where i did a watercolour and the colour was really intense and i lost the competition because the judges were confused they said either it s not really watercolour because the paint was too thick or i used watercolour in the wrong way so i lost because of that i don t know where those judges are today but ls it wasn't the best feedback you mentioned anna wintour and i wanna bring her up she actually sent us a question for you she said what will you name your son and what do you hope for him as he gets older kw i don t have a name for him but what i hope for him is that he can feel purpose that he can learn that he has the opportunities the other night i was driving in paris and i saw these three high school kids running at top speed i don t know if they were chasing a guy or what once they got up to the street there was a bus pulling off and they re beating on the side of the bus then i looked at the time and it was am so that might be the last bus of the night and i was really saddened because i was like how can i make my son feel that because once you ve felt that none of these fucking questions matter when you ve missed that last bus before when you had the opportunity to get on the bus you don t give a fuck about any of this ls when have you felt that kw when i ve missed the last fucking bus going through the streets of chicago and having to sleep downtown in a parking lot ls do you still get that feeling today about different things kw no it s almost like not feeling anything it s almost like being numb because of what i went through there s an employee that i m about to hire that was the global manager of accessories at a really good company and she was really direct in the way she was talking then she went into this thing about how she stayed in a concentration camp till she was five years old and she didn t know that people actually took showers by themselves after someone s been through something like that they could give a fuck less about fuck it s just like be real none of this facade ls do you care about the negative press coverage around you and your family but also just the general coverage that your every move is scrutinised kw yeah and that s the reason why with the help of anna wintour and other people we have actually made a lot of positive press coverage the majority of the press we get is actually positive because the majority of the things that we do are actually positive and even the negative can t outshine the truth the truth shall come to light you see it in front of you you read this thing and they try to diminish me into some really simple concept and simple idea and every time someone has a conversation about this and that they re like wow it s a possibility that he s thinking about more things and he wants to contribute more than i thought so let me dig into what i think the gist is of what that person was asking do i worry about being in the public eye and raising kids yeah any situation you re in you re going to worry about raising kids but it s champagne problems too there s people who can t feed their kids that s something more to worry about so i m not going to sit here and complain about the so called issues i have these aren t real issues there s people at war there s people trying to make it to london right now it s really fucking serious you guys are talking to me about some celeb shit that s not real shit you know what i m alive i m breathing i did a show we sell it i m doing a second collection i have no problems ls talking about the bigger things that do change who you are and completely affect your work carine roitfeld the stylist she ask how has becoming a father changed the way you work kw well the way it changed who i was three years ago after this interview i would have been on a train back to paris to see the last of the shows and get that inspiration and now i m on the first flight back home to see my greatest inspiration that s my daughter ls a lot of people have asked about your daughter a particular one has to do with having a daughter and how it's changed the type of explicit lyrics you put into a song and the way you talk about women in your songs that question came from ashley geevers she asked if having a daughter specifically affected the way you depict women in your music kw having a family period has completely made me rethink the way i rap you know people extend their brand for a long time there s true moments of genius and then there s just moments of looking through the archives and placing shit together so many people rate my beautiful dark twisted fantasy as one of the best albums and yeezus and s heartbreak are so much better and stronger dark fantasy is almost like an apology record power was the least progressive song that i ever had as a first single it was like me going back and spending six dedicated months it took over two years to release the album but six dedicated months piecing together what people liked about me to make an entire bouquet that they loved that was the most listenable that was the least challenging people want to talk about how much they loved that like it was thanksgiving dinner and how long has thanksgiving dinner been cooked for and it s great you don t want anybody changing things on thanksgiving dinner but you take s or yeezus where these albums got completely panned when they came out and then you see how they end up influencing things so it s that balance of doing something that gives you a blanket of comfortability for the listeners and for yourself that you can go on tour and do this and walk around and everybody thinks it s so great and they re really happy that you did something they liked and then you ve got the times when you just have to give them what you see as your future give them your innovation ls and having a family gives you more motivation to do that to be more true to yourself kw no ls that just comes from you kw i just love my family ls you talked about wanting to be given a shot and wanting to have your opportunity do you actually believe that one day you will be respected and regarded as one of the greatest of all time in fashion in exactly the same way you are in music kw of course i m michelangelo of course there s a time when i m sure there were people sculpting better than michelangelo but he made david so as far as that question goes is there a time that you can go on the internet and find a shoe that people want more than my shoes well go fuck yourself then if it isn t and don t ask me no stupid shit like that again with the love ls do you ever experience self doubt kw no ls never kw no ls even when you were little kw no ls okay good to know one thing that came in from a lot of people they picked up on that quote of your fashion being available to everybody they want to know what that means and when it will happen because price point really relates to that kw i m not h m i don t have giant factories how can i get the price point to what i need to be if i m running an eight person design team i m saying it s going to take time to get there this is what i m saying when you don t have the right tools this is the question that everybody has to ask if you had the celine design team and the nike design studio and the zara factory could you do everything that you thought you could do and what would everyone s answer be to that yes but if you don t have the celine outerwear person or the factory or you don t have the entire adidas studio and you don t have the marketing team or the sales team you can only do what you can do and we are doing a lot with what we have what we have is the highest level of communication that has happened in the entire universe my wife she s like mtv and nbc and all this combined number one on instagram and then the entire family and then you have me and my entire music family basically there is no ad that you can put in any magazine that could somehow add up to any one of me or my friends or my family just walking on the street and getting photographed that is the fucking reality of people ls does that make it easier to care less about critics because as you say it doesn't really matter what they say the percentage of people that would engage with that is a fraction of the percentage of people that would see one instagram post from kim kw yeah you know i mean what can i say about them i appreciate everyone s opinion but i refuse to have a lesser opinion about myself ls what specifically do you think fashion is missing that you can bring kw i m not even concerned about bringing something to fashion i m just i just want to be five years old you know when i was five years old i picked out my outfit for kindergarten i would go to discount furrier my mum would take me to discount furrier and i would keep grabbing furs and say what about this one mum or this one and they were always too expensive the ones i liked when i was five so i just want to be five years old i loved clothes before i even knew a fuck about the fashion world and i can t let the fashion world jade anything or try to give me a reason or purpose or a lack of purpose or acceptance or a lack of acceptance to anything to just who i am when i was five when my grandfather had a store in oklahoma and he d go to the flea market and hustle to get the best prices he d go and re do people s furniture he was a carpenter also he took that store and he was able to raise a family in a time where the schools were still segregated and he named my mother donda in he was predicting the future in and put himself in a situation where he was thirteen and his father put cents in his hand and told him he was out of there he raised himself in a situation to be able to put my mother into college to the point where she got a phd and became the first black female chair of chicago state university and then had a son that she then named kanye which meant the only one that would go on to combat every form of thought of tradition that the media have presented up to that point so tell me about other people s opinions again ls is it your family who have had the biggest impact on your creativity your sense of self and what you produce or were there other influences it feels like all your creativity came from your sense of self which obviously came from your family or am i wrong kw i can t say where my creativity came from i m blessed to be talented i would say that came from god my ability to give a fuck about somebody s opinion came from my family my ability to fight for my creativity came from my family i m sure people would just take that michelangelo comment i said earlier and would take offense to that and think whoa he still won t stop let me just explain the justification of that the proof of that ask any musician period of the past fifteen years and i would be the closest thing to that those were be the sonic paintings fashion clothes are sculptures wearable art now if you think about any brand do you love every single thing from a brand look at the few opportunities i got to collaborate with louis vuitton nike adidas really established companies and the level of love and impact people have for that product that had proper infrastructure so i had to take the money i made from being the motherfucking michelangelo of music of the past fifteen years and invest it in trying to build an infrastructure against all odds and basically building a sculpture studio so i wanted to raise the branch up a little bit higher on that low hanging fruit everyone was going to snatch at ls why run for president you have proven to be more influential than a president and running for office would limit your ideas everything you could do and would want to do as president can be done now other great leaders gandhi mandala never needed to be elected to make a change so why do you feel the need caden roberts kw mandela got elected ls yeah he s fourteen give him a break kw okay i won t start cursing at him certain things that i m compelled to do in life i don t feel the need to find justification for ls so you re definitely going to do it kw yeah ls when you made that announcement was it something you decided on the day or did it just come in the moment that you felt that and you just said it kw it had been talked about a lot for the past five years and talked about with my team and i decided i was going to announce it then ls do you think barack obama has done enough a lot of people have asked you that kw i don t want to make comments or give opinions on what other people have done i think he s done a lot of great things and i think that there would be no chance of people even considering the concept of me running if he hadn t have won ls will you run with a party or will you run alone kw i don t have all the answers right now ls what do you plan to do what are the some of the things you really want to do when you re in leadership kw i d like to sit with engineers and come up with solutions and alternatives for people without opportunity that end up having to go through desperate measures or feel like life isn t worth living or that other people s lives don t matter i think that the way i collaborate with people and the way i empower the people i collaborate with is a different way to look at problem solving for the world than a normal political way i just want to ask questions i ve already decide that when i m on debates and i don t know i ll just say i don t know i ll get back to you with that and i ll just consult with the top ten top five people on the planet and if there isn t an absolute right answer i ll say these are the two highest answers that we came up with right now because it s not about me it s we that s the whole purpose it s the skill set that brought me back from the original taylor swift moment the skill set that took the little kid in the pink polo to the top of the rap game that skill set that took a nike designer and three adidas designers and made the hottest shoe the skill set that brought by wife to the cover of vogue all of these journeys that like these questions say these absolute like this can t be done have been almost self serving and that s where it gets the i i i it s from me and it s from my family my family meaning my direct family but what happens if there is a certain point where it doesn t become about me and my family but my family becomes the human race i can do all the fight all of that confidence all of that problem solving all of that asking questions all of that trying to find the best answers and listening through if i could maybe do that to help more people and you can help more people in a position of power to go back to the gentleman s question earlier these are just now in a theory form but i am speaking from the heart ls a few people have correlated the president run with your lyrics and particularly the lyric about 'no one man should have all that power ' it s interesting you just said you can change your mind you can be wrong about things do you sometimes feel your own ideas have changed so much in the years you ve been working kw of course because you get new information ls does it frustrate you though because people are inevitably going to draw the parallel between the lyric and the fact you re going to run for president kw that s not frustrating there were some things earlier that were frustrating to me because they were so backhanded and ignorant in their approach not really embracing but no one s being like man i know i saw people lined up for three days for your shoes but one day will you be respected as a designer i designed that shoe didn t i i don t see somebody else s shoes getting lined up for i think there are a lot of fourteen year old fifteen year old twenty five year old thirty five year old people that respect me as a designer ls i met you at a dinner in paris with riccardo tisci and we had a really great talk and one thing stuck in my mind you said that you felt that there was a new form of racism called class and no one was talking about it i found that really interesting because i come from a radical background my father was a marxist and you told me your parents were also radicals can you explain to me more what you mean about that and is that something you want to explore further bobby gillespie kw yeah it s class is education people not having the opportunity to be educated the biggest thing that made me the uncontrollable whatever is simply by being educated simply being educated made me uncontrollable it s not that i needed to be controlled i needed to be helped i needed to be supported i don't wish negative on anyone i want positive for everyone i want everyone to win i don t want to be in a competition with anyone i just want people to be their best selves and live the happiest lives possible if you keep information and opportunity away from people certain people a group of people then it s destined they will stay at a lower class the combination of that and being american because i found sometimes when i ve worked at other design studios in london before i find that because of the way the government is set up people won t have the opportunity to say they will run for being the queen i m going to run for the queen that s from birth and you couldn t be the president of united states because you re not a united states citizen so it sort of circumcises your dreams from day one whereas american is like a land of opportunity when people can work their way climb their way up through the class system but to be truly honoured as a black person in what is a classless society the final house in the suburban community with the white picket fence and to be looked at as an equal is still a lot of mixed kids away from that but the world is mixing period so in a thousand years the world might just be completely what would be known as black currently but it would just be a new race except for people whose main goal and focus at that time is to keep the purity of separatism but i see the future as people being mixed i think that other races are really attracted to each other and always have been because i believe that we re meant to but taught to not i was taught to never bring a white girl home when i was eight years old but i like white girls i liked black girls too but i still liked white girls it was such a taboo i m sure like i said in the tyler song i know you told your daughters don t take home jerom i ll tell you from my single days that white women like black guys i tell you that but i think there s something amazing about mixing the cultures and the amount of informations that both cultures bring to the table or three cultures or four cultures you ask a girl and she ll say i m german and portuguese and asian just when i gave you that right now what do you picture in your mind there are probably guys gong ah shit i have to meet this german portuguese asian girl right now they already picture someone beautiful just by me naming different races together and having the idea that a woman is saying that she s mixed with these you picture automatically someone beautiful ls a lot of people asked about your vision for the world and what you d like it to be like it seems like that mixing of ethnicities and cultures is the most important thing to you kw i m not telling people who they should sleep with i m just zoning in on what i feel today ls do you feel like if you haven t dropped out you would be where you are because i think education is important but maybe the ability to opt out of the system is also important kw i think i would be further and more dangerous yes education is important i m envious of people who have read multiple novels and multiple philosophy books i wish i had more information i m thirsty for knowledge i m busy with my own ideas i want to pick up a book and see something that sparks me and it makes me think of thirty things i want to do and i ll put down the book and start working on that i m envious of information so college dropout now me at my age i m looking ok what were the reasons why i lost money when i did this what was the reasons why i failed at that it all came to not having the playbook to not having information with me when i work on fashion i m sitting here in the woods trying to chop down trees screaming screaming at the top of my lungs can somebody just throw me some water and everyone s sitting laughing at me that s the fashion world that s the fashion critics me sitting here trying my absolute hardest and everyone just laughing at me and only one person coming up with a camera and nick shooting a shot that then shoots across the world and they say oh he s working with nick knight and then pat coming in doing the makeup they go oh he s working with pat or riccardo coming in and saying no you can t talk about kim this is my friend right here they say oh wow the hottest designer likes kim then the fashion world is like hmm maybe it s okay and then they come again and say what do you think we can capitalise off of this in some way well come come we can capitalise and shit but they definitely were not fucking letting me in the shows and fucking constantly laughing at me and trying to keep the joke going but you know there s a lot of tsunamis and earthquakes that hit where people were joking on the beach so keep joking on the beach ls the kim thing is interesting to me i feel particularly working in fashion i feel like i ve watched it happen the period where people were so critical and now they want her in their shows they want to dress her they want her on the front row that must upset you in a way because she s your wife and as you said you love her to see that u turn in a way it s great because it shows how much people respect her and they can see how amazing her influence is but also that back handedness is that difficult because you must feel protective kw it s always always it s better now than it was and i feel happy about that ls we got a question from a guy who talked about gay people within music and within the rap world and stigma towards homosexual rappers he talked about how you talk a lot about society moving past stigma and being accepting he said do you feel that s still a problem within music kw yeah it s funny isn t it so funny how just the culture of different art forms is so different i felt that i got discriminated against in fashion also for not being gay whereas in music you definitely get discriminated against if you are gay it takes some amazing talents to really break down that barrier people don t have a problem with white rappers now because eminem ended up being the greatest artist and everybody thought that when frank ocean s album dropped that people were going to be like no this is bad for his career and he s one of the greatest writers of all time i feel like it s so cliche to speak about him particularly related to this subject but there always are the people who broke the ground and i think he s the one that broke the ground people don t give a fuck they love his music so so much it s the people that break the stereotypes that make history but i just thought it was interesting to point that out about the fashion world and the music world and just culturally it s reverse discrimination ls how did you feel when you heard that your stepfather was going to transition and become a woman willo perronc kw you know the first thing i did think of is i thought about black radio hosts maybe possibly making jokes about it because the black culture is generally so homophobic news cycles are just constantly they re just trying to find some news and some interesting things like this rapper has this transgender person in his family and but then i was like fuck what people say fuck what people think i feel proud to be in a family that has so many people breaking ground for the generations to come i just feel like whoa reality show like that s so fucking new of an art form to the point where my wife and their family should have had plenty of emmy s by now but reality shows are considered to be like rap was when the mondrian wouldn t let run dmc and motherfucking will smith stay there because they were rappers or the idea of a reality star not being allowed into a fashion show or not being nominated for their show even if it s the longest running and the most popular and everybody i know watches it and shit i feel proud that not only my contribution of the credibility that i gained and garnished from music and just my general social opinions that i could be next to a wave of thought of this is who i am and that is all i m about like fuck to let your life be controlled by public opinion would be like asking to sit in traffic for the rest of your life meaning like you want to turn this way but there s a car right here you want to turn that way but there s a car right there you want to go a bit faster but there s a car right in front of you you want to just stop cars start honking at you that s public opinion and bruce just got off the exit sign and drove as fast as he wanted to oh sorry it s disrespectful to use that name but i m still getting acquainted with what s politically correct because it s new it s modern this is like roman times bro this time that we have this years is really the beginning of the future we finally tapped into the type of technology and acceptance and thought that we need to look at the new pope it s a bunch of dope motherfuckers out here that are just pushing towards the future it s funny that i went to this train of thought off of willo s question because he is one of if not the most important person in my creative growth he is my number one instructor he is the reason why i was able to know who nick knight was he is my greatest home tutor and educator as i said i felt like i had the spark in me but mike tyson needed a custom model hercules needed that little trainer guy in that movie he is my greatest cultural coach as far as helvetica fonts go and operatic stages and you know honing and training and riding bikes around paris and analysing and philosophising about you know where the future can go and the whole idea of donda and what we do with design and the way we ve simplified things album covers are important again stage shows are important the signs long only sonic outros to songs this is all like an extension of my times and my trainings with willo ls hundreds of people asked this next album when s it actually coming tell us about the name what are you trying to communicate with it kw well as i said when i first said that name i wasn t sure if i was gonna keep that name but i just felt like i didn t want to walk around with the name so help me god for the amount of time i was working on the album i just felt like that was a heavy backpack to carry swish just kind of lightened the load so i could let it be whatever i want it to be so i could just work on the painting and find something which actually me and nick today he just showed me a piece i could say the idea but i was really inspired by some things and you can find the purpose through a painting through a video through a conversation through a sunset through a really tragic headline and it s like i was collecting these vibes and just things that i liked but the album had no purpose and it was finding something that s like wait a second okay it can go to something like this i always wanted to do this i did cool summer because i wanted to shoot surround vision i had this idea and for people out there who don t know what surround vision is i was performing with jay z one night on watch the throne and i was just looking at how the whole audience were experiencing the performance and i thought of this theatre experience where it was a screen above us below us to the left of us completely peripheral to the right of us and three screens in front of us and then we made this gyroscope system and put iphones on it and recorded some kids running across the street you saw them on this side then you saw them in front of you then you saw them on that side you heard them because we had a multiple speaker system you saw the ground below you and you saw the sky above you two weeks later we went to qatar and shot a film my idea because i couldn t get money from movie houses i went to def jam and said look i ll just do an album and the whole point was to get the budget i was thinking this should be easy you know i ve got all these rappers on my record label and blah blah blah then i ended up having to rap on seven songs and taking a while to finish the album it still has a lot of amazing songs and the idea was i wanted to do an album that s more commercial on purpose i want to show that i can make radio songs because before that it was and dark fantasy it was very heavy i want to show i can do something that s lighter i gave you this whole example to say the reason that i did the album was just so i could shoot that film ls a lot of people are asking about the films and what s happening with them and when they re going to get to see them kw hopefully yeah i m working on some ideas on how to be able to bring it back i don t want to make an announcement yet of when i think i m bringing cruel summer back but we re working on something right now ls in a lot of your last interviews you focus so much more on fashion rather than music it seems like your album has been delayed because you re working on your clothing lines is fashion your main passion instead of music does music not excite you in the way it did a few years ago kw no it doesn t excite me like when i heard wu tang of course it doesn t excite me like that it doesn t excite me like when i was using auto tune for my first time it wasn t my first time because i did it on college dropout too there were things to prove there were purposes there was lauryn hill and dead prez there was this idea of mixing this kind of messaging meets the hotness of rockafella and proving that this was a possible thing i am an inventor i am an innovator it s fine for other people to proliferate on an idea but i get excited by ideas not by responsibility so sometimes when i m even writing a rap it starts to feel like a big responsibility if you look at andre one of the top five greatest rappers of all time the majority of the time he actually only had to write one verse so as far as doing three verses sometimes you start to feel more like you re doing a talk show every night than doing some type of prophetic every two year speech i believe that there s raps that i had that meant everything and i believe that there s certain raps that were hot and there was something that meant something about hearing something that was just hot so i m not gonna say it meant nothing but it meant nothing for lack of a better way to describe it you know people could want so many things out of you and you don t want to let people down because of michelangelo comments and things you want to deliver genius you want to prove people wrong you want to prove people right that are fighting for you and sometimes creatively because i m held to task by the highest critics of every genre of art i feel like i m one of those guys that hundreds of years ago they would steal something and their form of death would be to be tied to four horses then they d whip all the horses at the same time and they d pull the arms out of their sockets each way that s how it feels when i m getting pressure from all the different angles it feels like my arms and legs are being pulled out of my body at the same time ls so there s no chance the album you re working on will be your last just to stop a bit of that pressure kw i d never call out what would be the last i'd call out what would spark more inspiration i will think of a philosophy or think of something i want to say i think hm this would be a great opening line or maybe i want to abstract the way you even hear rap a lot of people liked the original of all day better than the one that eventually got released and that was so much more like a freestyle but it left things really open which felt more like later picasso works oh yes as you guys know i think i m picasso also or the closest thing to it so lesser equal or maybe even better maybe there s something that s more cubist about the way i rap and that s what i m trying to find where it s like do you really need to paint every angel wing in their paintings weren t completely finished and here s another thing the majority of the things that are popular now are really directly based on something that i ve done over the past ten years you can pinpoint it like that was that album or that song ls does that annoy you kw i think it s amazing i think i had a purpose that was my purpose to innovate so if you hear something that sounds similar to something that i ve done before that is an extension of a new album for me ls so a lot of the people you talk about who you really admire or who you think are talented do you often see yourself in the work that they re making kw yeah completely ls so people you ve talked about working with or you ve cited in conversations drake young thug all these different people do you see that in their work kw i m not trying to specify people but i just feel like there is a lot of influence and you can almost pinpoint the moments when things happened but also i was heavily influenced by radiohead and james brown and coldplay and jay dillon and jay z and tribe and pharside and dr dre or quincy jones or teddy riley so all of that was in my work too ls with your lyrical process is it important to you that the listener completely understands explicitly what you re saying like with each line or is it better that they just take the abstract emotional gist of the song kw it totally relates to what i said earlier about finding you know i think that abstraction i wrote this thing down the other day i hope my words don t get in the way of how i feel my meaning but words fuck you know it s an extremely powerful tool that can be i just like abstracting music i like to listen to coltrane and say this is amazing i feel an era of that i feel a rise of that possibly coming after so many words ls a lot of people really relate to specific words carl swaygan said he listened a lot to particular aspects of your music and he talks about suffering from anxiety and ptsd and he said your music has got him through a lot he asked what gets you through similar things because maybe it s your own music but he talks about when you re feeling anxious or you re feeling down or you re feeling depressed what do you turn to kw i just talk to my wife ls what did you do before that kw talk to my wife or talk to my would be wife i talk to my friends i just talk i get really explicit you know with the way that i feel at that time i m extremely open that way i can sweat the anxiety out i open up the pores and sweat the anxiety out or sweat what i m worried about or say what are we doing if this is a game or this is a war how many soldiers did we just lose what can we do differently to win and to prove everyone wrong i appreciate naysayers i appreciate non believers because also sometimes it s weird for me when people do believe in me like someone ll come up to me and be like man i believe you re like basquiat people say stuff like that to me and i ll just be like wait a second only i can say that about myself ls that s a question that someone asked about the pressure you feel on yourself because things like i am a god this sense of you being a divine power does that scare you does that freak you out lots of people wrote in and they said lovely things like his music s got me through the hardest time he stopped me from committing suicide he stopped me from fucking up my life but you must feel a sense of pressure from that when people treat you like you are this kind of god to them kw the reason why i made the song i am a god is so those people that feel less than can turn it up and say it loud and embrace it for themselves that god is inside all of us it wasn t about specifically me it was about us as a race that we are an extension of god that we all have god inside of us ls one question that came in a lot was if you could give yourself advice now to when you were dropping out of college what advice would you give kw there s so many things that had to happen for me to be sitting here with you right now it wouldn t be truthful for me to give a statement as arrogant as i wouldn t change a thing because when i sit on a long flight to paris all i do is wallow in the things that i wish i could have changed things that i would have tweaked so as far as the college thing i don t seem to wallow on that that much but if you asked me a straightforward question about it i d say the more education the better the more you know well sometimes you can know too much especially if you don t have the opportunity to do things and it can drive you crazy and that s a bit of what the yeezus period was like to know that i was simply not succeeding due to lack of resource due to lack of assistance and to have shown so many times that you had an ability but for people to doubt your ability because you re not playing your position the position that they want you to play you re not tall enough to be centre or something like that ls what was the scariest moment of your life kw probably my car accident a lot of time i try to find answers that are like mmm i wouldn t have expected that but yeah that was pretty scary ls you talk about luxury and about the only luxury we have being time what do you spend most of your time doing kw working on luxury that probably is it i do spend the majority of my time working on my goals to create this creative ecosystem that allows a bunch of ideas to flow through them i m sure nick could probably relate to that i probably spend the most time on trying to create something that allows me to create everything ls thinking about improving the world one question that made me laugh it came from boris johnson who the mayor of london what would you do to make london better kw widen the streets cause they get really scared ls how do you think your portrayal through lyrics visual quotes of the black woman formed pop culture s understanding of black women and do you think it is within the function of contemporary black male rappers to uplift their female counterparts in the face of adversity kw i definitely think generally rap is misogynistic and it s just a part of not saying it s justifying the culture i definitely think i ve said bitch get out the car in some of my lyrics and stuff like that and is there a responsibility i feel like rap for the years that i ve studied it it s only as a whole responsible to trend so the only way that specifically what she s talking about would be hurt more if it was more in style rap is a communication of trend it s a communication of the way people are in real life it s a communication of what someone just said to their girlfriend on the phone or an argument they just had or something positive that just happened what i notice is there was a time when we had afro centric rap and everybody was like how common is it was like my queen this that you haven t even heard the word queen so long in that context what i ve noticed is when i come home from a meeting with some head of a studio and i just get completely dissed and i show them a bunch of creative things like on despicable me where he was trying to show his mum he could make a rocket and she was like whatever that s weak that s how it is going to meet with people in hollywood and showing them your ideas they just shit on you like we don t need that it s weak and i ll come home and i ll find myself being more irritated and maybe being more rude with my wife so let s take that to the idea of a black male in america not getting a job or getting fucked with at his job or getting fucked with by the cops or being looked down upon by this lady at starbucks and he goes home to his girl and just to think about my frustration and if i was rude to my wife because of that we are like super well off to the point where this guy is like i can t take my kids school shopping if i knock my manager the fuck out if he says this to me one more time they cannot drink the ye juice at all they cannot turn up at all it s like you scream at the person closest to you this song that chief keef put out that i sang the chorus on i was singing i scream at you cause i can t scream at nobody else and then take that and you go to a studio and that frustration and disrespect is now coming out towards the woman next to you or the women around like we can t wife you you re just a thot we can t do this blah blah blah and the guys around are just like you d better not say that to them or i ma shoot you it s from lack of opportunity it s from being inside of traffic that thing i told you earlier that lack of ability to see a way out and you just start being frustrated inside of that space and then you go into the studio and that s what it s gonna sound like i ma shoot you fuck you bitch because that fuck you bitch came from america that fuck you bitch came from our lack of opportunities that nigga i ma shoot you came from racism which is an amazing tool it s like if you could put racism in the battery of your phone it would never stop working it works on itself it s residual and shit residual racism is to be in a racist situation where you re working at this fucking job downtown blah blah blah they re treating you like shit and you go home and you re just mad at everybody it s like black people don t even like black people at a certain point racism is the hate that keeps on hating and i said this thing i was sitting with steve mcqueen when we showed our piece that we did on all day and it we put it in the lacma let me say that again just to purely be a dick because i said that knowing it was a stunt and very intellectual so me and steve mcqueen i think it s a very impressive thing to say shit like that right after saying nigga nigga fuck fuck wee wee wee i said i just embrace racism he just looked at me like what the fuck do you mean you embrace racism i was like no it s here this thing is like we re in a jail cell are we gonna keep fighting this how do we just embrace what s in front of us as opposed to always pinpointing that it s the reason you re being held back but i realised in order to truly be one of the greatest artists and one of the most remembered artists i ma get off the social subject and switch it more into the art and fashion context again is that same assistance that i begged for and got frustrated for the fact that i m starting to do it without some of that assistance is what makes it truly historical and what demands the respect and that s the reason why even in the beginning there s like an intellectual olive branch of your show had more meaning than just being an oversized sweatshirt i refused that intellectual get that fucking branch out of my face i ain t gonna take it i ain t gonna take the meaning that you proposed upon me this is what i meant and if it s not good enough for you then fuck you my aunt one time she let me see robocop and my dad was really strict and i came home and was about to tell him and she grabbed me and said you re really a glutton for punishment aren t you almost like a masochist or some shit right and like in a way i am i kinda like pain i like the challenge i like making things harder for yourself because if you can beat the game on the hardest mode possible you ll be the best of all time so that means if i become a good designer as a black straight american entertainer rich dude all the type of shit that says you shouldn t be able to have any creative thoughts then it s like the ultimate fucking win then you re like eminem or tiger woods or barack obama just someone who just completely broke all boundaries and it s exciting this interview is exciting because it s such a battle of perception and a battle of the intellects and a battle of culture and a battle of class a battle of taste it s like y all motherfuckers know i m gonna win this battle it s so fun though it s so fun because the whole trick i always say is i m an artist and an artist can basically take on any shape form and an artist can paint anything so when i m like opening up the yeezus mountain on tour and stuff with the margiela mask you know some nights in the middle of one of my rants i m just like i m sorry the gig is up i was actually never really a rapper i was always an artist and that s the reason why i m just killing this shit so hard right now so when you talk to the lighting guys it might not come out as good but don t feel bad because i ve been trained since age and went to college for this shit it s always like that secret thing you know it s about sharing information jews are a culture that share information that does not happen in the black community for your family your son maybe day one this is how this community works this is how we grow together and that racism slave mentality nigga mentality show off mentality i ma fuck your bitch mentality all that is like what makes a culture that has all the highest physical attributes going for it the weakest due to simply like that speech dicaprio gave on django simply removing the esteem and that is why i refuse to fucking back down you have to know that you are somebody you have to know that it s possible whether you re creative whether you re a black person in america whether you re a black person in london you know you have to know it s possible you have to see me keep winning against all odds i will win until i die i won t lose i can t lose because then it s like they win they meaning the mentality the old guard of thought because we re just a thought a hundred years from now we re all just memories ls do you feel it s true all creatives die alone due to lack of understanding in some ways what you re saying you sound super positive but in other ways there is that sense of pessimism and people not understanding do you think that statement s true kw well i ve said a bunch of wild shit and my wife hasn t left me yet so let s hope not but i think there will be someone who will understand everyone i don't know maybe there is a someone for everyone i m trying to be overly positive ls i can t really think of anything profound that i don t already know about you so here s a really simple question that i actually don t know what would your last meal be kim kardashian west kw oh it d definitely be some of of her home cooked fried chicken ls going back to the women thing it s a question i want to know would you say you re a feminist kw i think i m a humanist is that a party but yeah come on like so many black kids in america i was raised majority by my mum my dad was around i would see him in the summers and the springtime but i think i fight for the importance of any community that is not being properly accredited just period of anything this statement is going to sound kinda gay but i m gonna say it i love older white men but basically if you re not an older white man you don t run shit it s always gonna be more of a fight for anyone that isn t an older white man period so i like to speak on behalf of people without a voice and sometimes that could be a creative sometimes that could be a woman sometimes that could be a man turned into a woman my dad five years ago would live in a homeless shelter to counsel with ex drug addicts and you know he really cares about people it s like as soon as he moved to where he is now he was like how can we improve the water here how can we improve the education system i just met this girl she s in this situation with her family this and that what can we do to improve this that s all he cared about it s caring about people so there s something where it s like i live my life i get to be a rockstar a rapper this that and then at a certain point it s at that moment where you just look and you see people dying and being on top of their roof and you just look at the camera and say george bush doesn t care about and that s like my dad and that s my mum i ll go to a football game and i ll be looking at the game and i ll watch the score and i look at the human score meaning like the people there and i start to zone in and think like where did this person come from what did they go through what type of job have they got what brought us all here today what are their interests it s like sometimes that part of my dad comes out of me that starts to get really intrigued with who people are so even when i design i am going to make the apple of clothing i don t think there s a purpose of saying you want to do it because it s obvious i want to but want is like this politically correct way to word your future accomplishments this one guy was super snobby with me at a fashion dinner of course and i explained to him that there was a time when people said i couldn t rap and he asked me oh so is this what you hope to do in clothing i was like i don t hope i execute as far as apparel goes i will make the apple of apparel and the apple of apparel isn t high street it isn t fast fashion it isn t a sweatshirt it s the thing you want to keep for the rest of your life just looking at human beings sometimes you present things people don t even know that they want it yet i could show you two photographs i ll show you a really well known designer that s highly respected blah blah blah that i pulled as a reference to proportion because they had this silk jacket it almost looked like a lining fabric if i describe it too well they ll know what i m talking about i don t want to say the person s name but it had like denim on denim and like a sock on a shoe and different things like that it was after i did my sock shoe and i had a photo i had just done and the guy had an olive jacket on cotton on cotton self lined a tank top the colour i probably couldn t even describe it almost an orange but really subtle and the shorts are like some beautiful light brown with a bit of grey in it and the guy was black that the clothes were on and everyone who i showed those two images together now the one image you even know who the designer is and it s top five designers in the game and you see this image right here and i m like which one and people always pick this one because of the colours and people don t even understand how important colour is as an opinion in clothing give a fuck if i got any of the cuts right on the last collection anyone who doesn t say i had an emotional connection to the colour palette they don t even know how to see anymore they don t even know what they re looking at they see clothes and they re looking at numbers they re not feeling emotion they re thinking about trend they re not seeing future they re not seeing luxury they re not seeing time like oh shit i wanna go to the park with my family i ll just throw this on that s what i want to do is present something that gives people some of their time back because it works together like lego and you just throw it on and i m not saying that i mastered it by season for christ s sake i didn t hit watch the throne and dark fantasy on my second mixtape but the theory is there and only i can do it only i care about it that much only i have the exact and code in my head i could say it out loud i could say oh this army surplus but look at how far we jumped from army surplus in the second season so just think about where we ll be by season look at how far we jumped cause i have the code in my head you have to cut open my head and take my brain and put it on top of some big organisation and you can t it s like completely you know that sweatshirt that t shirt decision i m making is a piece of my mum having me at operation push at age five it s a piece of my dad going to the homeless shelter it s a piece of my grandfather having a store where he fixed furniture in the back it s a piece of my cousin bootlegging cross colours out in la it s a piece of my aunt that was the chicest woman that i knew even when she had alzheimers she would dress better than the entire family and i remember the colours and they remind me of the colours that we were able to find we were able to start to find and penetrate this concept by the second season without being held back by the fabrics that were available to do all black and only have a navy blah blah blah i don t use blue it bugs me out ls tell me about the colour blue kw yeah i hate the colour blue on this collection katherine hamnett was emailing me about how i had to have blue jeans and how i d need to have a white shirt and this and that about i was like i guess i could see how i would need that but like i said i like to make it harder for myself by just doing what i want to do ls you say you like to make things hard for yourself and you re so driven and you re so passionate you re obviously ambitious are you happy kw so so so so happy and i m happy for the normal reasons to be happy because i married the woman of my dreams and i have a beautiful daughter and so many beautiful people around me and my cousins and families in different states there s so many loving people i have a son on the way i have a lot of life ahead of me and i have the opportunity to be completely rogue and to be able to support myself being who i am exactly and now i ve even opened up a whole new place to create by being able to do apparel and then going in and doing film and being able to take those horses that at one point were pulling in all these different directions and pulling my arms out of my sockets and re aim them in one direction and have the most powerful four horses running towards you that tsunami about to hit that earthquake about to come in some people might not see it and for the people who don t see it and don t understand what s about to happen you know certain people are visionaries certain people are early adopters certain people are just followers so i take it that the most negative reaction is from the followers i need to know you down to do whatever down to get it poppin' down to get topless

frontin' baby i need to know november september mcqueen you've been on the scene as an artist now for years which is impressive given the level of interest and artistry that you've managed to sustain in your work in the process you've become incredibly influential so you talk about doing all of these other things which is great but there's really no amount of money that could make you more influential than you are now so my question is what are you going to do with all of the influence that you have right now west well influence isn't my definition of success it's a by product of my creativity i just want to create more i would be fine with making less money i actually spend the majority of my money attempting to create more things not buying things or solidifying myself or trying to make my house bigger or trying to show people how many louis vuitton bags i can get or buying my way to a good seat at the table my definition of success again is getting my ideas out there the first company that has really given me a shot is adidas they did the deal i mean damon dash did the deal at the end of the day he signed kanye west years ago what does that mean now what does that mean to music you know people say things about creativity and jobs and every years blah blah blah but i don't have a desire to not continue making music when i left chicago and moved to new york it wasn't because i didn't love chicago it was because i needed to go to new york so right now i've got other innovations and other thoughts that i want to pursue as i was saying earlier i create like a year old when you're you wake up one morning and say i wanna ride a bike and then the next day you wake up and say i wanna draw i don't want to be in a situation where because i was good enough at riding a bike one day then that's all i can do for the rest of my life i mean you know firsthand being a fine artist and then moving into the hollywood space you know i say to renzo rosso bernard arnault and fran ois henri pinault the heads of diesel lvmh and kering come to my show and look at the mountain i made look at these people screaming and then tell me i don't deserve to design a t shirt if i want to design a t shirt in my lifetime then please help me do it people say well why don't you just do it on your own are you telling me to sew every single t shirt people say why do you antagonize the high end companies and your fan base and this and that but what i'm saying is that in working with partners like louis vuitton and zanotti and balmain and fendi like i have and please forgive me for using film as a metaphor because i hate when people do that with music i feel like it's a better form of film that i'm working with when i work with them i'm working with better cameras i'm working with better editors steve please forgive me because i feel like it's super patronizing whenever someone does an analogy or a metaphor that relates to the field that you currently work in mcqueen no not at all west i'm sorry i find it super insulting whenever people give me a music analogy it's like you know i would have understood it if you just said it in english you didn't have to put it in music terms like you somehow know more about music or i would understand it better if it were in music terms so please forgive me for putting that in film terms i mean talking about film to steve mcqueen mcqueen i grew up in europe in london and you grew up in the states when was the first time you came to europe do you remember west i think it was when damon dash had me and some other roc a fella artists come over he stressed the importance of connecting with london especially then we went to france and i hated france when we first went there now of course i love it but at the time there was a rapper out of chicago who wanted me to show up at some event of his and he was trying to threaten me in some way physically if i didn't show up because we had done a record together and dame dash had to man up on the situation and apply a bit of gangster to have them fall back just for me to be able to get on that first flight to london mcqueen it's interesting how when malcolm x ventured out of the united states for the first time he went to europe he went to africa he went to mecca and then when he came back to america he realized that to some extent for him it wasn't about black or white it was about people in talking to you now it seems like you feel the same way that it's never really been about race for you but at the same time it has very much been about that if you know what i mean west my mission is about what i want to create it's for people for humanity it's about things that can make the world better i'm not saying that i'm going to make a better world i'm just saying that i will provide some things that will help and my glass ceiling that i'm facing is based on my color you know i was looking at some cheesy ass mtv videos a while ago and it was so funny because it was like wow these videos are pre michael jackson and people forget that michael jackson had to fight to get on mtv because he was considered to be an urban artist this was like the greatest pop star of all time and they told him we're not gonna play your video because it doesn't fit our format mcqueen it actually stunned me to find out that you've never won best album at the grammys i suppose i shouldn't be surprised but it's kind of odd considering what you've done in music over the last decade west i wasn't even nominated for best album this year this year i only got two nominations by the grammys for best rap album and best rap song mcqueen well that's my problem with all this stuff it's ghettoization and i'm talking about country as much as rap it's all just music and i've got a problem with people kind of trying to categorize it where it's either good or it's bad i find it all odd to be honest have you ever been nominated for best album west i've been nominated for best album maybe three times i made dark fantasy and watch the throne less than a year apart and neither of them got nominated ni as in paris as much as years a slave but hollywood likes the idea of a black director directing years a slave more than it likes the idea of a black director directing shame this is my problem with interviews you know what if you did music and someone else could come in and change your words around and then release it to the radio and you don't even get a chance to listen to it before they dropped it to radio that's how interviews are you you say what you say and then you'll get paraphrased and then they'll do shit like if you say a joke most jokes are inappropriate they's they're like fucked up things that you say but it's kind of funny the way you word 'em and if you take away you know the setup or the punchline you just sound absolutely crazy which is they love to do that because i love to joke and i give them too much and then my shit don't be like all dry ass interviews and stuff like i don't have media training or whatever and then so they take that and i and i told gabe i said look well i wanna i wanna do uh i wanna get approval over the shit just because i wanted to be as entertaining as possible i want people to have the information and you know like a lot of magazines they got real uptight they like no you 'on't get approval you 'on't get approval you don't get approval so you know when i say the line 'bout the rolling stone i don't have a problem with rolling stone i really appreciate the fact that they did put me on the magazine and i realize that you know i was halfway out of my mind for the past two years and shit i was you know off that drug called fame and shit like that i was really like i was like a little crazy you know what i'm sayin' like i've calmed down and shit and like come back to earth so you know for the editor of rolling stone i wanted to say that but i do wanna say that it was pieces of the article that was information in the article that was incorrect and you know if you allowed me to proofread it the people could've had the proper information and just to speak to the dave lachapelle 'cause dave lachapelle's one of my favorite photographers modern day warhol i wanna speak to the cover you know people say okay well he has a god complex fam if someone's in college and they do like a play where they emulate christ do they have a god complex are they allowed to do that you know it's because of my position it's like i'm not allowed to be creative so every cover i take has to just be a picture of my face and shit just look it's my face it's me and sometimes it's like after you see after i see me so much i get tired of me and shit i gotta look at me every day i wanna do shit that's exciting to me so the rolling stone's cover was exciting to me that shit went down in history i did it purely for creative reasons it was't speaking upon you know anything disrespectful to christianity to anything like that it was something i did purely creative lot of times i do shit and people take more out of it you know like i said bush doesn't care about black people and then people took it and said well you said bush hates black people you know everybody takes it and makes it what they want it to be when you know i just say i express something you know the other day somebody came to me like okay well who you voting on barack or hillary and i'm like i'm not really political dawg i'm not getting into like you know i'm taking sides and this type of thing he's like what do you mean you're not political you're not i was like fam i'm emotional i'm social i'm like i'm an artist like if you give me the opportunity i'm like the fan that got too close to the stage and shit i'm the glitch in the matrix i'm like the last person to say yo i really feel i know i'm supposed to feel like this and know i'm supposed to read this teleprompter or whatever but i feel like this what i wanna say that doesn't put me i'm never going politically incorrect or anything i don't know about politics like that i just know about people i make music for people talib kweli yes welcome to the wonderful sounds of talib kweli ladies i got you in the mood for an interlude raw like in the nude i hope this ain't considered rude but let's stop talkin cause it's feelin like an

wrong you know what maybe you're right aight and i wonder if you know what it means what it means and i wonder if you know what it means to find your dreams you say he get on your fucking nerves you hope that he get what he deserves word do you even remember what the issue is you just trying to find where the tissue is you can still be who you wish you is it ain't happen yet and that's what intuition is when you hop back in the car drive back to the crib run back to their arms the smokescreens the chokes and the screams you ever wonder what it all really means and i wonder if you know what it means what it means and i wonder if you know what it means to find your dreams and i'm back on my grind a psychic read my lifeline told me in my lifetime my name would help light up the chicago skyline and that's why i'm seven o'clock that's primetime heaven'll watch god calling from the hotlines why he keep giving me hot lines i'm a star how could i not shine how many ladies in the

what it all really mean you wonder if you ll ever find your dreams have you ever wondered where'd it all really went wondered if you'd ever ever find your dreams wondered if you'd ever ever find your dreams wondered if life had never been that it seems wondered if life is all about the high beams the flashin' light tryin' to get your money right and you be up all night tryin' to stay fresh today fresh like mr west and i'm proudly the best i been sold on to that guest uh the number one on the charts why is that because i rap from the heart what i always did from the start how i always played my part uh they thought i was so crazy i got a deal with jay z now they got to pay me and they looked up lately i sold a million the first week 'member when i just sold my first beat shit can change and it never stayed the same ma i wonder i wonder what it would be now what it would be now you all standin' in the crowd ten thousand now they hate everythin' now everythin' now or every single i

my shit and i'm gonna talk my my shit and they can suck my my my my i wonder why they talk so bad have they ever had a artist that's so mad and they will never realize what they have somebody real in the industry if nobody's real then i guess it's me and they freedom and it's not free cause every time i talk freely they attack me they give me backlash backlash backlash black but they can kiss my ass my ass my ass my ass i say why ask why ask why try but try can they's fly now touch the sky touch the sky touch the sky and i wonder baby to can know what it means what we know and i wonder baby if you know what it means i told you but if i would have voted i would have voted on trump now there s people that i love that did vote that voted for hillary and i don t love them no less because they had their opinion i love friends that i have that voted on hillary my manager scooter braun voted on hillary one of my management team my other manager izzy i m gonna assume voted on hillary everybody said that if you voted on trump you have to go back to like montauk or shit and guess what that entire team still put together this show tonight with people with differences of opinion still put this show together tonight and still came together and made this show for y all they told me ye do not say that out loud whatever you do do not say that out loud and i just said it i wanted to say that before the election and they told me do not say that out loud whatever you do do not say that that don t mean that i don t think that black lives matter that don t mean i don t think that i m a believer in women s rights that don t mean i don t believe in gay marriage that don t mean that i don t believe in these things because that was the guy i would have voted for run the next song believe that there are people here enjoying or before i start talking at least enjoying a kanye west show by a show of screams do you believe that there are people at a kanye west show who voted for trump oh it sound differently from before huh it sounds different why did we boo the first time on something that wasn t hey do you like trump that wasn t what i asked i asked you to give me your facts because the internet was giving you their facts based on what you wanted to hear and a lot of you guys got blindsided how that make you think though the fact that i just asked that undeniable question that in most music situations you have the democrats always since the beginning of time the democrats were considered to be more liberal the democrats were supposed to be more futuristic in their approach the democrats were supposed to have more empathy and be more about the people and that relates directly to music and it also relates to celebrity and the idea of what music does for you democrat is like music to your ears or something bye your voices do you believe what percentage of people here and by the way i m not setting y all up i m not setting y all up i ve got no time for bullshit what i m saying is what percentage of people here do you think voted for trump do you think it was two people here do you think maybe it was people do you think maybe it was people out of the people here no i m asking you what do you really believe one person two people what do you really believe what do you really believe what do you really believe what do you really believe what do you really believe what do you really believe i haven t talked about anybody s stances on anything i haven t talked about any quote that anybody gave from either side that s not what i m talking bout that s not what i m asking you what i m asking you is what you really believe i put something that i would bet on i bet that it might be percent or maybe even percent of this very audience right here that might have voted for trump i bet you percent percent of them would never say that at a kanye west show because of the climate right now and they don t know they might think i m like oh they voted for trump y all should go ahead and it s the opposite of that people got the right to vote for whoever they want to vote for that s the right to vote that is our right i did not vote aww no the saint pablo ticket sales are going down now aww no t shirts aww nah you just got out of jail ye you had to deal with the taylor swift shit for seven years now you gonna go say some naw ye don t say shit just step out fuck that bro that s the reality well ye how you gonna expect people to vote for you if you ain t even vote i m concerned not about the idea of being president or the actual job of it i m concerned about putting our concept of how to do the job in a new way and if no one will do it in that way i will take position in and do it myself aw you ain t gonna get it now because of what you just said it was proof that it didn t matter what nobody just said it doesn t matter it might have been a reporter who wanted to use this as an opportunity to say oh this rapper because when they call me a rapper they try to say that i m less than thinking less than a philosopher but rappers are the philosophers of our now the rappers all form a sense of our now the celebrities are the influencers of our now just look at the president he wasn t even in politics and he won that shows you not if you mad about him winning but that shows you the level of possibility that is out there if you go and find information and don t believe everything the fucking internet is telling you there is possibilities there s possibilities inside of books there s possibilities when you call grandmother motherfuckers be on the internet way more than they calling they mother or they grandmother to get information that would have you wrong as fuck like everybody knows a couple days ago do you ever want to be blindsided like that don t trivialize what i was saying when i talked about our president s approach to the campaign when i said it was entertaining i don t think his approach was just entertaining because that trivializes it i actually think that his approach was absolutely genius because it fucking worked next song oh shit you threw something at me does anyone else wanna throw something at me but you know what i got the power to get that guy kicked out or whatever roughed up no stay here what do you believe that s your opinion express your opinion bro express your opinion thank you that s a woman right there saying i love you after i just said that there was things that i liked about trump s campaign that s not supposed to happen right no that s not supposed to happen right case in point aw no well no i guess we re not gonna sell out the rest of the tour now there s methods nonpolitical methods to speaking that i like that i feel were very futuristic and that style and that method of communication has proven that it can be a politically correct way of communication and i fuck with that you threw something at me naw he wanted me to sign his yeezy i don t say out of disrespect to our president at all i m not saying that aw man that just mean that anybody can win that s not what i m saying when i say i ll just say i got some ideas about the way that we should connect our ideas and we should use opposite parties that the republicans that the democrats that everyone that ran that had an idea that people agreed with should be the collective ideas that are used to run the country and that should mean more so there's things that benjamin carson believes in that i believe in i believe that benjamin carson should still be a consultant i think that hillary clinton should still be a consultant i think that bill clinton should still be a consultant obama said i think obama should still be a consultant it s that oh i don t fuck with your principles so now i m not gonna give you no information that could help you help all of us make sure this dude that got the yeezy get his yeezy back specifically hey security get it back man and you know what also i m not saying this to diss celebrity and that all who are particularly on the democratic side that s cool i just like i hate the fact that because i m a celebrity everybody told me not to say that i loved the debates i loved his approach it d be like white people that s racist running around saying niggas now if people are racist and they feel more inspired to say how they feel then they exposing themselves bro this is what i m saying it s already the beginning of change sometimes things that you might think are bad have to happen in order for change to fucking happen sometimes you might have to not get your way to really understand what to do in the future to be able to get your way we at war we at war with terrorism racism but most of all we at war with ourselves jesus walk god show me the way because the devil tryna break me down jesus walk with me you know what the midwest is young and restless where restless niggas might snatch your necklace and next these niggas might jack your lexus somebody tell these niggas who kanye west is i walk through the valley of the chi where death is top floor the view alone will leave you breathless gasps try to catch it gasps it's kinda hard getting choked by detectives yeah yeah now check the method they be askin' us questions harass and arrest us sayin' we eat pieces of shit like you for breakfast huh y'all eat pieces of shit what's the

denied emotion derived from posters of pride of african cultures and tribes who live when we suppose they die laugh when we suppose they cry the pain we holding inside cause all we really know is survive use that to remember we're kings that's why we so addicted to diamonds and rings and cutless supremes seen diana ross remember that my sisters is queens the lord is coming for now he visit in dreams for every mission it seems impossible speak to the gospel to remind me what god can do when it's not logical to those in hospitals and prisons low income living for them i say a prayer keep giving learning to receive my heart is burnin' to achieve even when it's hard to breathe i still believe that before you take my name take my fame while you at it take my shame take my flaws take my blame feel my dirt conceal my hurt see my bruise do this and you will walk in my shoes you wasn't there when i was in deep thought when i had two choices kill him or either leave new york but i'm a truth teller that's why i say what i'm saying and the only thing the radio playing is cause you be paying it ain't about who really hot no more beats wit knock no more so who cares who flop no more i realize that most labels pay you for lies and only law dudes can disguise that your favorite artist shhh i know you hear that huh you wanna fear that what your worst dream is that you was gonna hear that icon to rap is like john the baptist prepared the way for what i came to say today they deceived us having thinking jesus really didn't need us when he loved the old days he loved them boys in the hallway up in broadway even those who re up for dope every four days to the strippers in broad day up in norway to the detroit player gators in marbres with me it's not just bars of music i walk with god i got the scars to prove it jesus walks god show me the way now the devil can't break me down jesus walks with me the only thing that i pray is that my feet don't fail me now everybody out there just lift your hands right now just say this with me father i thank you for forgiving me of everything i've ever done for jesus walking with me for dying for me raising for me and all my sins have been forgiven i'm a changed man i'm healed i'm delivered i'm rich and it's all because of him now walk with me walk with me walk walk walk with me walk with me jimmy kimmel my guest tonight is a time grammy award winning performer who last month threatened his very existence by threatening one of america's most beloved television personalities we had a big dumb fight on twitter but he was nice enough to agree to come and talk about it tonight please welcome kanye west jk how are you kanye west i'm okay jk i'm very happy that you came i'm glad you did and i wanted to clear this up i really felt bad about all this stuff i did kw mm hmm jk i guess the first question i should ask is who are you wearing kw it's ralph jk kramden lauren jk is that a new grill you have there kw nah they've been in my mouth for three years jk that one on the bottom ok well it's good to see you kw good seeing you too jk i guess we should talk about what happened because i do think that somewhere in you you want people to understand where you re coming from is that true kw yeah correct jk so we did a sketch on the show where we had you did an interview with the bbc radio and it was an intense interview and i ll be honest with you i only saw a couple of little parts of the interview when we did this sketch kw yeah that s what i thought jk in fairness there was context to it and we took it out of context and we had a couple of little kids reenact it which i didn t think would be something that bothered you do you mind if we show a little clip of it little kanye i've reached a point in my life where my truman show boat has hit the painting i'm not trying to regurgitate myself i'm a product person not just clothing but water bottle design architecture anything you could think about brought the leather jogging pants years ago to fendi and they said no how many motherfuckers have you done seen with leather jogging pants jk i'm gonna tell you something the truth is the main reason i did that is because i like to see kids curse i think it s funny kanye laughs and i think that some people read into it differently that we were positioning you as a child but that s not true in fact we ve done this to other people with lady gaga with quite a few people that we've had kids say what they said and reenact them of course this is not something you knew and this is not something that people who just watched it online or whatever knew and you called me a lot of people think this is some kind of publicity stunt that you and i cooked up but this isn't right kw i mean everyone out there in tv world real world whatever world you stay in needs to know that i ve never done a publicity stunt in my life any time i went up and spoke my mind whether it put my career in jeopardy or whatever someone so called said it was always what i thought was the truth whether i'm like reading from through a teleprompter or whatever i felt emotionally i don't follow like rules of normal celebrity or what their publicist tells them to say so i don t do publicity stunts period so don t ever think that jk me neither guys laughter so we talked on the phone and i didn t really know why you were calling i heard you were upset but i didn't know the context and we had a bad conversation right kw yeah i knew you before and i saw you at a wedding and i remember you telling me i want people to know this side of you and different things like this and i saw this good guy at the wedding so when i saw the skit which i didn't watch all the way through because i didn't want to be infuriated i was like i know you so it was a combination of me knowing you but also me not knowing the person who put a bad headline on the cover of in touch and me not knowing this person so i was like this is the one person i know so i can go and let out everything that i feel about every single bogus weekly cover every skit every single rumor in barber shops everything that people feel is ok to treat celebrities like zoo animals or act like what they're saying is not serious or their life is not serious or their dreams are not serious and you know it kinda just went and elevated from a call that we just had as men that elevates sometimes you take a guy jimmy does his thing and i do my thing and at a certain point these egos can flare up and we kind of just took it back to high school for a minute jk and i got beat up a lot in high school so i didn't wanna go back to high school jk and this is something that to be honest with everyone this is something that when you're with another celebrity we complain about this zoo animal it's a perfect thing because people online they just want you to click through so they'll put whatever they can put as a headline to get you to click through and it can be damaging and i think people look at you and they go this is a guy who s got millions of dollars he's got a beautiful wife and a new baby we can t possibly hurt this guy and to be honest even though i m in that same position too i don't have a baby it s not something that comes to my mind when i m cooking up a comedy sketch and some of these things are hurtful and the truth is important and it's but on the other hand i will say a lot of times you i think you bring it on yourself this kind of misunderstanding about you i personally found it odd to be in the position that i was in because i often i don t know if you know this a lot of people think you re a jerk and i often in my own personal conversations say no i know this guy he is not a jerk in fact i think we have a picture which i happened to see on my dad's ipad at the wedding and it's you and my dad who you may have though was wolf blitzer in fairness but i mean to go to a wedding of a friend of mine and you took a southwest airlines flight to that wedding just to make it for this guy who was just a coworker and then to be so nice to everyone there that tells me a lot about you everyone's nice to me when they meet me because they know i have a talk show and almost everyone's on their best behavior but what i observe is how celebrities behave around other people how they treat our staff and how they treat in this case my family and i ve always said that to people about you and i think that's important for i know part of you doesn t care i see you onstage saying i don t want to hold your baby i ll drop your baby on it s head you know i don t believe any of that stuff when you say it kw i m not running for office i m just here to make good music make people feel good when they hear my music and you know when i did that interview i was really vocal about a lot of things that i've been dealing with over the past years when i was put in the classification of just a celebrity because you know for me i m a creative genius and there s no other way to word it i know you re not supposed to say that about yourself and i say things the wrong way a lot of times but my intention is always positive and i wanna bring more things to the world i want to help the world i want to make peoples lives easier i spent of my checks in telemarketing when i was years old on a pair of gucci slippers and this is before there was h m and zara you couldn t just find cool stuff when you were growing up and for me i care about cool stuff it means something to me it means stuff to a lot of people that are like me and that s what i was talking about on the zane interview so when i come on here i can laugh and i can joke and i can see a skit and we can say ok we love kanye or we think his baby is cute or whatever but for me it s bigger than who i am and my presence living it s about when i was on earth what did i do to help and at what point did i hit a glass ceiling where people said you re a celebrity so you can t help in this box you can t help in this box but i talked to quincy jones at john legend s wedding and you do music you can do anything once you learn how to produce you re a producer you understand textures and colors i have an art background even before i was a musician people told me i couldn t rap people had all this advice for me about how i shouldn't try to rap and i wouldn t even say i m a rapper i m more of a messenger than a rapper so even when you say rap beef it sort of undermines it and keeps re contexting what i said whereas if you look at the zane interview it s really something extremely fearless for someone in my position to do because most people just like bow down to tv or bow down to these cameras like i could care less about any of these cameras all i care about is my family i care about protecting my girl protecting my baby and protecting my ideas and my dreams and ya know that's the reason why i went so crazy jk i wanna go back to one thing you said which is when you say you re a genius that upsets people but the truth is a lot people think they re geniuses and nobody says it because it s weird to say it but it is most certainly more honest to say i am a genius kw i m totally weird and i m totally honest and i m totally inappropriate sometimes and the thing is for me to say i wasn t a genius i would just be lying to you and to myself jk that's true it s false humility kw oh my god it comes with your first ticket to la soon as you get off the plane here s your false humility maybe if keep up with this act long enough and go with this agency they'll give you a star on the walk of fame one day for kissing everybody's ass but it's like that's not what we're doing by the way i want to shoutout the walk of fame because they said something like they re not gonna put my girl on the walk of fame because she s a reality star it's like people are so so dated and not modern there s no way a kim kardashian shouldn t have a star on the walk of fame its ridiculous old concepts and you know for me i m just gonna give y all the truth it s like my grandfather loved ali until he died and my grandmother hated ali til she passed so you re gonna love me or you re gonna hate me but i m gonna be me jk alright kanye west is here more with kanye when we come back announcer the best tweets of kanye west josh groban can we please toast to the motherfuckin' douchebags tonight do you know where to find marble conference tables looking to have a conference not until i get the table though at most his tweets are characters but the depth of his passion is immeasurable fur pillows are hard to actually sleep on man what ever happened to my antique fish tank announcer you'll get all of your favorites josh groban classical music is tight yo i make awesome decisions in bike stores french fries are the devil black is the new black announcer and many many more josh groban's the best tweets of kanye west includes original songs on cds josh groban i love me announcer in stores now so now that was funny right i imagine the skit was probably funny too it wasn t that funny to be honest with you it was a five i d give it so i do want to ask you one more thing about the tweets because i just want to be clear bring up that yeah that do you really think i look like spongebob it s the first thing that came to my mind where were you when you were writing those tweets i like to imagine on the toilet yeah that s when i think of the best shit i was just at my place here my old home here in la as we were writing it there was a frustration i was getting out but also they were really funny to me as i was writing it and i just thought it was so amazing that i was saying this in real time in real life you know with my position people are so scared to say anything you know as soon as you re a celebrity you re not to say anything anymore but just to completely wild out the only reason i could do that is because we could speak on a similar level and we can go back and forth it was a crazy thing to see that happen as far as just the technology and all of a sudden everyone in the country knew you and i were having a really dumb fight i just thought that that was amazing to crack media in a way you know i feel that media does everything they can to break creatives to break artists to break people s spirits and i do everything i can to break media from my standpoint sometimes i ll think of things and maybe it s two o clock in the morning on saturday night and my wife will go don t tweet that do not tweet that because people take things out of context but you just do it you don t care you shoulda saw the second set of tweets save them for next time i do just want to say congratulations on your new baby in fact i brought you a little gift i made fun of this but there really is such a thing as leather jogging pants and there s some tiny little leather jogging pants fashion isn t always practical it s more about emotion it s more about swag it s more about you know pussy it s more about like club it s more about style and stuff i remember me and my boy virgil that created the line pyrex vision we sat as interns at fendi like six years ago we had cue cards and everything and the leather jogging pants is one of the things we presented that didn t go through and the reason i brought that up in the zane interview is because there are people who made whole careers off of creating leather jogging pants it became a phenomenon over the past three years and it was to say you know i would sit with hedi slimane who s now the head designer of saint laurent and he d say stop giving these big brands your ideas and everything and it would just be like what i was trying to express in the zane interview was like me i know i m hip hop and a rapper and everything but i ve got ideas that mean something if i could put the proper production around them so when do a nike yeezy or a louis vuitton shoe the production around it was at the same level as the production on my cd or when me and rick rubin or mike dean of whoever are working together but if i go out and make my own t shirt or something and i call it kanye everybody s gonna think about when i just called myself a creative genius and say what s so genius about this but when people line up for the yeezy they re like oh wow this is like really genius you need that production but currently in fashion and the way the fashion world works there s no black guy at the end of the runway in paris in all honesty and that s what i was talking about when the truman show hit the boat what about a steve harvey collection yeah no there s no steve harvey collection no extra buttons on jackets or anything like that but for michael jackson michael jackson had to fight to get his videos on mtv because he was considered to be urban this is michael jackson that s true he was considered a black artist and was not right for mtv at that time yeah a black artist so for me think about this when i m in paris and i m sitting in fashion week for nine years and south park makes fun of our outfits and all this or people don t understand why we re there i m getting called names like stuff you can t even say on tv and i still can t break that wall down at a certain point it s like michael jackson trying to get his videos on because who do you know who s known more for clothes than me to not be able to do and produce to the highest level and to have a meeting with everyone i m talking about andrew rosen of theory this guy over here this guy who runs this company leanne these are the real people who produce the clothes that are on your back zara out there with ortega francois pinault everyone and everyone just sort of looks at you like you re crazy and like you don t crash the internet and you re just like how can you get a shot and then you try to do it on your own and like real designers will work for a rapper and you just cannot overcome it i mean my grandfather drove the first cars in the marches just to get clean water and one of the parallels i wanted to do for you is like richard pryor used to always talk about he just wanted a clean plate he just wanted to serve his stuff on a clean plate so if i do an interview in w magazine right and they take all these classist shots at me because it s not about racism anymore it s classism that s what i talked about paula deen she was old school with it they re like we don t do it like that anymore paula deen we re classist now so this classism is what they do to try to say you re a rapper or your girl s on a reality show you re not up here with us you know we re old money we it s snobbery it s snobbery and i m not into all that snobbery because you know what we have the loudest voice we have the loudest communication and all we want to do is make awesome stuff all we want is a real shot not ok i m a celebrity so that means my line has to cost ten dollars a t shirt no i understand about quality i understand about fabrics i spent ten thousand hours at this i ve dedicated my life to this and a lot of people say ok you have to do music i m gonna keep doing music but what if people told me i couldn t rap what woulda happened what if people told me i couldn t perform i m only years old i have other goals and other things and i m gonna use my platform every platform to stand up and say i want to make something i want to make the next ralph lauren that was the point of the zane interview to say people don t stand up to protect their dreams people are too scared of getting you know spoofed in a way and the irony of it is think about a creative person in school when you picture them you re probably picturing them all the way in the back of the class sketching or maybe getting beat up and i m the one creative and this is the reason why i did this because creatives have gotten beat up my entire life and there s moments when i stood up to drug dealers in chicago and said you can t have my publishing come and kill me do whatever you re gonna do but you re not going to bully me you re not gonna stop me because my mother made me believe in myself no matter how many people tell me stop believing in yourself stop seeing what you can do stop affirming what you re gonna do and then completing that in real life that s the improper way to do it i refuse to follow those rules that society has set up and the way they control people with low self esteem with improper information with branding with marketing i refuse to follow those rules it s about truth it s about information it s about awesomeness and the only luxury is time the time you spend with your family that s the only luxury so this concept of luxury is improper to me you know with nike with apple you remember there was phones that cost dollars somebody pull out a vertu phone right now you look ridiculous but there s people who still spend five thousand dollars on this bag ten thousand dollars on this to say oh we re better than you i mean taste culture art you know just the quality of your life this is what i m here to do so when i compare myself to steve jobs or walt disney howard hughes david stern michelangelo da vinci jesus of whatever it is i m saying these are my heroes these are people i look up to this is the type of impact i want to make on the earth if i can make this type of impact up to this point what can i do if you call bob iger and say yo give him a shot if you call oprah and say yo back this kid this kid his parents were educators he wants to educate he wants to look at curriculums and say how do we simplify that exactly what i did in music i want to apply to product i want to apply to education this is what my company donda is about i could rap all i want but without that roc a fella chain and damon giving me that roc a fella chain i don t care how beats i sold to whoever i couldn t have made it to the point to make jesus walks and now even as a celebrity i ve reached a ceiling and the way paparazzi talk to me and my family is disrespectful also we bring something of joy to the world when people hear my music they have a good time and i should be respected as such when i walk down the street don t ask me a question about something you say in a tabloid don t try to antagonize me cause you know what it s not safe for you in this zoo never think that i m not from chicago for one second and think you can walk right up and disrespect me and my family constantly and people say well you signed up to be a celebrity blah blah blah it s like you know what and i understand paparazzi you gotta get your money it s hard out here but let s have respect for each other you do help me get money paparazzi you show people how fresh my outfit is that helps me influence people but when they show up at your house in the middle of the night and your wife and your daughter are there there s no human decency there it s a lack of decency kanye west everybody i'm like twista on the rap side i'm like weave on the track side i'm don juan on the mack side i'm michael jordan scottie pippen and pac's son i'm phil jackson this is south side they call me kan' the louis vuitton don but i still might throw on a little on same place where the from same place i got my flows from place i got my hoes from talkin' tell me if you know somethin' go on 'head roll somethin' bitches get they on when you turn luke on gangstas dance but they still get they on bad boys ii on and she want to go i'm a cop the bootleg from it for the show watch the dvd in the car cause the way a nigga live we have more tvs in the whip than in the crib my nigga sells cellphones we call him lil' flip welcome to chicago my city is the shit i wanted to take white trash t shirts and make it a video i wanted to make it as phony as possible i wanted to show you that this is the type of imagery that has been presented to us for years and the only difference is a black man in the middle and the grammy goes to 'the college dropout' kanye west umm ya'll might as well get the music ready cause this is gonna take a while umm when i had my accident i found out at that moment nothing in life is promised except death if you had the opportunity to play this game of life you need to appreciate every moment a lot of people don't appreciate their moment until its passed and then you gotta tell them al bundy stories you remember when i but umm right now is my time and my moment thanks to the fans thanks to the accident thanks to god thanks to roc a fella jay z dame dash g my mother rhymefest everyone that has helped me and i plan to celebrate i plan to celebrate and scream and pop champaign every chance i get cause i'm at the grammys baby i know i know everybody ask me that question they want to know what kanye is getting well louder he's gonna do something crazy everybody want to know what i would do if i didn't win i guess we'll never know kanye west on why he doesn't care about his legacyevery time i crashed the internet it's like this little drop of truth every time i say something that s extremely truthful out loud it literally breaks the internet so what are we getting all of the rest of the time i don't care about having a legacy i don't care about being remembered the most important thing to me is like while i'm here while we're having fun while we're going to sleep in breathing oxygen and living life and falling in love and having pain and having joy is like what can i do what can i do with my voice what can we do for each other to make life easier to make life doper for our kids you know as they grow you know we were born into a broken world we're like the cleanup crew you know my mother made me believe in me when i was growing up i wanted make video games my mom got this amiga computer when i was in seventh grade and it had colors i found myself running home to use this sound program that allowed me to place in notes it would stay place another note it would stay place another note and it's how i learned how to produce in seventh grade i was just really making music to make video games they just let me dream they supported me they pushed me they didn't set me up to be inside of a box weston main thing that makes magic magic the fact that no one believes it's possible when i entered the fashion world and i encountered a lot of elitism and all that it just made me happy it was something fun we had the entire world against us it was like absolutely no allies whatsoever you know what i mean it was like the world was against us the pressure of that was like crazy was like a super bowl i remembered sitting there with my fashion publicist debra and we're supposed to do the resee these is the thing with the editors after the show so they come back to see it and see if they like the collection and we had like two or three people that came to see it and take picture with kanye and bla bla etc i say do we have more editors coming and debra just look and says no no one else is coming and i looked at her and said this is great remember this moment cause it won't always be like this embrace this moment when no one came to see the collection i take things that people look as a negative as an inspiration to do something better i think there are school teachers that are at the exact same mission as as me i think there's police officers with the exact same mission as me it's just help it's just do everything you got give everything you got and you know our focus needs to be less about what our legacy is gonna be or how we're gonna control each other but more how can we can give to each other kanye west on being the robin hood of fashion somebody please transcribe these kanye west on why he's not in a competition with anyonei'm not in competition with anyone none of us will be remembered you know our existence as a race humanity in period is a blip another second of our life in the entire scope of the universe all these walls to keep us from loving each other as like one family as one race you know racism religion you know where we grew up whatever it is class social network economics you know all this what makes it be so selfish prideful all mixes now want to help the next man what makes us you know be so focus on a personal legacy as opposed to an entire legacy of a race you know like the dinosaurs are remembered from much more than their bones you know so for humanity's gone what do we give to even this little planet you know now wrong and what can we do collectively like removing the pride somebody please transcribe the rest grammy awardswon best rap album the college dropout best rap song jesus walks best r b song you don't know my

call from kanye and he says i m at dover street market where are you and i said hey i m at dover street market he recalled i always said i would never shoot a music video and here we did one in days that s kanye it s been a wild ride the director said west played him his entire forthcoming album so help me god and he decided to blend elements of two tracks shooting the video at chatham dockyard with west donning a vintage t shirt acne jeans and his new kanye west x adidas originals yeezy high tops in an interview after his performance his wife kim kardashian curled up on a sofa manipulating her iphones west was unequivocal about how fashion shows particularly in paris nourish his creativity as a musician i would have never been able to design a show like what you saw tonight if it hadn t been for my experience in paris learning how to minimize and make design decisions how we started with just the single light said west a stickler for details who barked at security guards between songs for loitering in front of the giant screens surrounding the stage upon which images of boiling clouds waterfalls stars and smoky forests were projected it s part of the show he pleaded while a divisive figure in fashion many are put off by his front row ubiquity and often surly behavior west clearly relishes his role as a cultural lightning rod where style art and music intersect the hip hop artist lauded the creative people that work here the city itself the music that s played at the shows the colors the palettes i actually get a lot that i take back and put into music west s ties to lvmh mo t hennessy louis vuitton stretch back to when he performed at a fendi event in tokyo later collaborating with louis vuitton on a sneaker range in more recently after meeting at a givenchy show west struck up a friendship with alexandre arnault who doffed his dior homme jacket at the show and bopped around with his friends mouthing the words to songs on the playlist which included all of the lights and ni as in paris a tour of the foundation building sparked the concert idea when i saw it i was just so in love with architecture and the modern space and the way they curated the art i just asked would it be ok for me to do a performance there west said tickets for the four concerts which end tuesday sold out quickly at euros or a pop west said all proceeds would go to charity meanwhile kardashian had spent part of saturday at the hairdresser to adjust the color on her new blonde locks which had assumed a yellow cast not the platinum she was after he fully got the color right and it s so perfect i m like don t make me fly out to paris every time i need to color my hair she said with a smile i m happy with it it s a look but i have a couple of shoots coming up and everyone is like huh what s going on kardashian said madonna was partly the inspiration i ve always had references of madonna with platinum hair they ve been on my computer forever she said letting slip that she would keep the color for an upcoming campaign but clammed up on the brand like west kardashian keeps a rein on her image noting that the black coat slung over her shoulders at the concert which she took off as the heat intensified was a c line style she altered to her liking making it slimmer changing the color from white to black and adding a fur collar my mom has the one that s just as is so i feel like mine s a little special she said and now it s a really dope coat west concurred kanye ok dope you still got the nashville number taylor i still have the nashville area code but i had to change it kanye for all my south side niggas that know me best i feel like me and taylor might still have sex taylor i'm like this close to overexposure kanye oh well this one is uh i think this is a really cool thing to have taylor i know i mean it's like a compliment kind of kanye what i give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend taylor that's sweet kanye i want things that make you feel good i don't wanna do rap that makes people feel bad taylor um yea i mean go with whatever line you think is better it's obviously very tongue in cheek either way taylor and i really appreciate you telling me about it that's really nice kanye yea i just felt i had a responsibility to you as a friend i mean thanks for being so cool about it taylor aw thanks yeah i really appreciate it like the heads up is so nice taylor things without like even asking or seeing if i'd be ok with it and i just really appreciate it taylor i'd never expect you to tell me about a line in your song taylor and then the flowers that you sent me i instagrammed a picture of them and it's the most instagram likes i've ever gotten kanye relationships are more important than punchlines you know taylor yea i mean i don't think anybody would listen to that and be like oh that's a real diss like she must be crying about taylor you gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it like you honestly didn't know who i was before that taylor it doesn't matter if i sold million of that album before you did that which is what happened you didn't know who i was before that taylor that i can make these things happen and i have the ideas to do it and i create these things and concepts and like i'm always gonna respect you taylor and i'm really glad you had the respect to call me and tell me that as a friend about the song it's just a really cool thing to do and a really good show of friendship so thank you kanye thank you too taylor and you know if people ask me about it i think it would be great for me to be like look he called me and told me about the line before it came out like joke's on you guys we're fine taylor you guys wanna call this a feud you wanna call this throwing shade but right after the song comes out i'm gonna be on a grammy red carpet and they're gonna ask me about it and i'm gonna be like he called me taylor awesome that you're so outspoken and it's gonna be like yea she does it made her famous it's more provocative to say might still have sex taylor it's not it doesn't matter to me there's not one that hurts my feelings and one that doesn't they used to chill down park used to chill down springfiled that's how you know it's real from right here in maryland yeah i've been doing my thing all on the tv i remember years ago nobody would believe me i lost my mama i been through so much drama i've been through so much drama i'm voting for obama i know that everybody feel this i know that everybody feel this even the media try to kill this they don't nobody that's really real that's gonna give them tell them how you really feel then say something back that come straight from the heart and don't give a fuck if it ever really top i'm the real hip hop i'm the realest alive i'm the realest motherfucker that you see that you cause y'all all stars everybody superstars throw your hands in the air wave them like you don't care now say hell yeah grab a seat grab a seat so you remember this place graduation it s cool yeah i was also thinking about some of the other things we ve done as well with the bbc like abbey road sprung to mind with the strings oh yeah that was good that suit was like i would ve worn something different if i could look back right now i could still do a suit i just wouldn t have done that exact lapel situation but talk about really putting yourself on the line with that that was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and that kind of to give yourself that objective what are your thoughts when you think back about abbey road where it s just nuts i thought it was good i thought it was what i was supposed to do at that time if i see something if i see an opportunity i m gonna go for it you know what i m saying we re all gonna die one day yeah that s true so live like that live like you could die tomorrow go for it those steps have been the you know the platforms that allowed me to make it this far and you have man and you re here six original albums of your own a throne record various records with g o o d music to talk about man but seriously man yeezus bravo dude i mean that is one of the most creative records of any genre i ve heard in a very very long time and you know just in terms of your output your most exciting sounding record i think oh thank you very much yeah i feel i was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again not having to speak with the textures of the time cause you know cruel summer is definitely kanye west and there s something weird and kind of off about mercy like when it has the high pitched that type of sound it sounds like art still a little bit even thought it obviously was a radio smash but it s still when i get into the idea the trap drums and things like that certain songs that are blatant radio hits it s like i m speaking with today s textures and that s if you look at it years from now it s not going to stand out in the way that s or yeezus stands out and can completely push or redefine or make people say you know hey i completely hate that or i completely love that but let me just think differently because everybody is bound to these no pun intended they re bound to sixteen bars or eight bars and you know the normal radio the radio thing i was talking to frank ocean about this and said my mom got arrested for the sit ins and now we re more like the sit outs like sit off of radio and say hey radio come to us we need to find something new because it s being controlled in a way and manufactured in a way that really awesome artists can make amazing music and not break as far past as like something that s very formulaic so it almost feels like a duty to you in a weird way having the peoples ear having peoples attention for great music to be able to say well if i m not challenging them enough i m not challenging myself not challenging radio what am i doing yeah i m not trying to regurgitate myself i showed showed people that i understand how to make perfect dark fantasy could be considered to be perfect i know how to make perfect but that s not what i m here to do i m here to crack the pavement and make new grounds you know sonically and society culturally you ve done that with yeezus yeah it s fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now because normally when i talk to artists about records of this nature it s in the lead up to something so we re all kind of playing a guessing game you know what i mean you could tell me what you think of the record but i m trying to find my way around it the audience probably won t have heard it in this case it s been out for a minute so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight too you ve seen what everyone else has had to say about this record both good and bad but i m fascinated to know today how you would describe yeezus as someone who made it how you would describe that record you know i just think that i m a production person i m a product guy i m a producer so if i m working on a john legend album i m gonna try to give john legend the best home for him to stay in and i m gonna try to push pusha t no pun intended once again this keeps happening to me to make the thing that represents what i like about his music the most and then for me as kanye west i gotta fuck shit up laughs ah ha ha and you did dude seriously from the minute it starts i mean seriously on sight beginning plays it s disgusting so you re up in the loft probably at this point and you re kicking around ideas and you re putting things together and this sound comes into your head and you re like this is what i m looking for nah this is me going to the studio with thomas and guy manuel who s daft punk they had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there this is just one session right here this beat was originally like minutes long and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted and i ended up making that the intro you know i got a beef with you over this track it s too short i wanted more out of it cause it s one of the best beats on the record for me and it feels like you re just getting warmed up was that kind of deliberate you know to pull back after only a couple of verses and go you know what we re going to get on with the album now nah it s just what i felt like it should be and you know originally blood on the leaves was supposed to be first wow which psychologically i know would have changed certain yeezus naysayers about the album it wasn t that time for me i i i didn t want to come up there and perform a lot of times music can be presented as a service position but i wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music you know people go on a vacation and say you got the drugs you got the music you got the wine it s in that territory but i wanted to speak up and say okay so my voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music it s the only place where i actually have a deal so i can only consistently make things in music so i m gonna take music and i m gonna try to make it three dimensional like like like on star wars and the hologram ll pop up out of r d i m gonna try to make something that jumps up and affects you in a good or bad way whether it s i m going into a scream in the middle of the track because that s just the way i feel but i m not here to make easy listening you know easy programmable music no you re so off the reservation on this album in the best possible way like you talked about the way you use your voice in different ways you don t rely on conventional rhyming flows your opening line yeezus season approaching you know a monster s awoken you re laying it out there this isn t my beautiful dark twisted fantasy part i m wilding out on this record straight away interlude plays from on sight and then from nowhere as well we just get treated to these wonderful moments where like you say it s almost like a collage like you re sitting here going you know why can t i go into this why not you can and you did that s how life is it s like a car crash you could just be driving and just out of nowhere it happens at what point did that very deliberate feel to the record whereby breaks come in and join this really discordant electronic moments and everything seems to exist in this very very contradictory but it works kind of way at what point did that start to take shape because it is very omnipresent through the record as a whole the way it flips between one and the other was that in your head early on or did that come towards the end when you started to reduce the record well i didn t reduce it rick rubin reduced it he s not a producer he s a reducer laughs nice but was it always part of the process for you to say why don t i take elements of this and this and just claps hands bolt it together yeah it s just the way i was consuming information in my life at the time negative information to positive information from the internet just going to the louvre going to furniture exhibits and understanding that trying to open up and do interviews with this learning more about architecture taking one thousand meetings attempting to get backing to do clothing and different things like that like getting no headway whatsoever it was just that level of frustration this is what frustration fucking sounds like this is what frustration sounds like like for me as kanye west i would not be kanye west if it wasn t for michael jackson i was with quincy jones a couple days ago at john legend s wedding quincy was telling me it wasn t just mike but these guys broke down the barriers of course you know michael jackson he had to fight to get his video played because he was black this is michael jackson michael jackson s not even black he s michael jackson you know what i mean it s like he s he s so crazy how can he even be classified as this black artist so for me in my life and creativity it s been challenging yeah it s been challenging and everything but i was able to ascend to massive heights because of the foundation that my mother and my father and my grandfather laid through civil rights what michael jackson did with music videos and the ground he broke there would be no kanye west if it wasn t for michael jackson that allowed him to be that right ya now let s take people who have issues with me as kanye west they classify my motivational speeches as rants like why is he saying that why is he doing that well i ve reached a point in my life where my truman show boat has hit the painting and i ve got to a point that michael jackson did not break down i have reached the glass ceiling as a creative person as a celebrity when i say that it means i want to do product i am a product person not just clothing but water bottle design architecture everything that you could think about and i ve been at it for years and i look around and i say hey wait a second there s no one around here in this space that looks like me and if they are they re quiet as fuck so that means wait a second now we re seriously in a civil rights movement like people used to joke about remember our south park photo yeah i do remember how funny that was do you think there would be a givenchy in the hood if it wasn t for that south park photo but no one thinks about that no one thinks about the names i got called for wearing tight jeans you reference that in the record you talk about that no one s liked him since he s been wearing tight jeans everybody knows you brought back real rap i mean you reference that in the record i m saying y all had all that but i brought real rap back i m going to do dope things and i wanna take this opportunity to speak to something because i go to hypebeast sometimes to look it up the new things that re coming out and every time my name goes up there s a series of people who write just negative comments they wanna joke around and say why is he still trying why is he doing this why is he they like diss me as a person for trying now mind you i ve brought years of product that has added to humanity ya you know and now what they don t realize when i say hey this is pusha t this is what it is i have to remind pusha t that he s pusha t because the radio if they re not playing a song of his that has an r b hook on it or works at a certain level of trap tempo and plays in it s like we forget about that clipse album that meant everything and the reason why i relate it to design and what we do in design is saying that s the music that us as creatives that wanted to get into design we looked at clipse as the gods and this is our soundtrack to creativity and it s not a trap beat that comes in on that soundtrack to creativity you know what i m saying no knock to trap cause i did can t tell me nothing i like it but it s been commercialized to the point where and i m not mentioning no names but what but people used to use the term r b nigga but then it was rappers but then rappers didn t wanna be no r b nigga now the rappers is the new r b niggas the rapper s the new radio like where s the culture at where is the culture at so then i scream and i m sitting in the middle of it whether i m at a dinner with anna wintour or you know i m at a listening session with pusha or me and virgil are in rome giving designs to fendi over and over and gettin our designs knocked down brought brought the leather jogging pants years ago to fendi and they said no how many motherfuckers you done seen with a leather jogging pant meaning when i see hedi slimane and it s all like ok this is my take on the world yeah he got some nice jeans in there it s some nice ones here and there some good shit here and there but we culture rap the new rock n roll we culture rap is the new rock n roll we the rock stars it s been like that now for a minute it s been like that for a minute hedi slimane it s been like that for a minute we the real rock stars and i m the biggest of all of em i m the number one rock star on the planet we are the real rock stars and i m the biggest of all of them i m the number one rock star on the planet there it is that record it says that that s what your album says when you come out and there were songs on there you make that very clear so what i want to explain to everybody out there it s like i make music i can do it but i shouldn t be limited to only one place of creativity and it s literally only like one or two or three reasons why i haven t been able to break that down but why would you feel that you are because and i m just this is the thing you guys don t understand you guys don t understand you guys don t understand that i did the yeezus and they ebay ed it for right and people wanted them bad as whatever right but i didn t get a call from nike the next day you guys don t understand that i ve met with companies and they say what we re trying to figure out is how we can control you and control that if you re a architect if you re a world builder if you have all these ideas and you re gaudi and you want to build buildings if you don t ever get that out what s going to happen isn t that why you do it isn t it the process isn t it the point to do it i don t think you re really hearing what i m saying but i m trying to as a creative yeah for you to have done something to the level of the yeezus and not be able to create more and you cannot you cannot create that on your own with no support with no backing so when i say clean water was only served to the fairer skinned what i m saying is we re making products with chitlins t shirts that s the most we can make t shirts we could have our best perspective on t shirts but if it s anything else your truman show boat is hitting the wall and what s more important to me about this than everything that i can do sonically and everything is if i go somewhere and someone says hey we don t like kanye west you ve heard that before right what people don t realize is i want to make uniforms for my high school basketball team through brand yeezy i want to make that one step and then make another step and then eventually do uniforms for the entire city then i want those uniforms to be hot and make money and make that i eventually want to be the anchor and the force behind a billion dollar company and after i make that billion dollar step then i can go in and say hey i ve got an opinion on this and that could be a ten billion dollar step and i eventually want to be the anchor of the first trillion dollar company but when you sit and you have a meeting with a company and show them the most innovative take on theatre because you thought of it one night while you re sitting on top of watch the throne set which you designed with es devlin and i designed the set with es devlin and i thought of okay surround vision there should be a screen above you below you to the left to the right of you and front of you also then i paid my own money that i get paid for doing gold digger which i never really liked that song but i always knew i would get paid for doing gold digger then i shoot a film in qatar with three camera crews with nate brown virgil matt williams nabil all of these crew all of the people that every video that pops up every other day on hypebeast that s my crew right so we go out and shoot that three camera crews over five days edited over days show it at amfar no show it in cannes the night before amfar on the beach build it in a pyramid with rem koolhaas agency design the entire thing put editors in it blah blah blah people give a standing ovation i do an interview in new york times the next year to say hey i did this and i want to let you know i did it right yeah and then it doesn t get mentioned in the interview and a week later they do an interview with george lucas and steven spielberg and they re talking about what the next frontier of theatre will be and how it ll be higher priced tickets and it will be something that s surrounding you and blah blah blah but maybe it s in the goggles i said wait a second i just only did the interview to tell people that i invented it i made it like i went i remember when i was dropping william morris right and then sarah newkirk at that time said before you drop them go meet with ari emanuel and i sat with him and i said ari i m an inventor and he goes on to tell me about the way it works and what he said is you are a celebrity so basically what s going to happen is there s product here and this is where you end up right here if you can communicate this product you can make money off the product because look at gaga she s the creative director of polaroid i like some of the gaga songs what the fuck does she know about cameras so it becomes all of this thing where all of the musicians the musicians try to get more money by promoting other products right so you ll say hey you know what i ve got this water and we ve got you know we ve got this red version we got a red bottle and we ve got a david beckham version here then we got a blue version so my opinion is no more than the patina on top of it when i understand the reason from my core of why something should work all the way through so i understand we want to make it about music but i wanted to take this step to say we got this new thing called classism it s racism s cousin this is what we do to hold people back this is what we do and we got this other thing that s also been working for a long time where you don t have to be racist anymore it s called self hate it works on itself it s like real estate of racism where just like that when someone comes up and says something like i am a god everybody says who does he think he is i just told you who i thought i was a god i just told you that s who i think i am would have been better if i had a song that said i am a nigga or if i had song that said i am a gangsta or if i had song that said i am a pimp all those colors and patinas fit better on a person like me right but to say you are a god especially when you got shipped over to the country that you re in and your last name is a slave owner s how could you say that how could you have that mentality i mean i know in the past you ve talked about like you know building hotels doing things that are beyond people s normal frame of reference yeah they know you as kanye west an artist they know that you re moving into fashion but these things i guess in a way are hard for people to comprehend because they don t have that level of drive do you know what that mean has it always been like this for you have you always felt like you can set your mind to anything and you will achieve it ultimately i always felt like i could do anything that s the main thing people are controlled by thoughts their perception of themselves they re slowed down by their perception of themselves if you re taught you can t do anything you won t do anything i was taught i could do everything and i m kanye west aged so just watch the next ten years yeah yeah yeah one thing i want to express to people also people think a lot of my motivation is very like megalomaniac and self oriented to the contrary completely i just want to help from day one i just wanted to help like my father was a black panther my father was a journalist a paparazzi a photo journalist he was a paparazzi we had a dark room in our house like seven years ago he lived in a homeless shelter not because he was homeless because he wanted to help the ex drug addicts he wanted to get that close he started a foundation called good water and moved to the dominican republic to help right there to help with the prostitution to help with the extortion to help right there he stays in dominican republic right now my mom was the first black female chair of the english department there is no award show there is no amount of billboards there is nothing that that can define me or make me pass what my parents made me and that s exactly who i am and i put on that pink polo and say broke broke and broke through the tv and now you got to interview with me because their president who is coming out the gate he was like it ain t going to work but me i m here you know what i mean by i m here like meaning like i got no play on yeezus on a radio right no no not entirely true by the way a little bit but no number one records no kanye west blah blah right so then i was going back at forth with the company i m in touring right now and i said i want to perform in the round and then creatively we just couldn t find it so i said put me against the corner like how we did in watch the throne well just do that instead they said well you know we just can t technically do it because why technically why why can t you do it they said look if you do that you are going to be in breach of contract right so basically meaning like if i didn t sell the tickets i would go into debt right so they pushed me my back against the ropes right and i said i ll take that chance i ll take that chance right so pre order the first day in chicago doubling watch the throne four pre orders in one day that made the people stood up said we like what kanye is saying we like new slaves but we do that all the time yeah but not through radio well yet but i m a radio broadcaster and i love your records i mean for me no i m not pin pointing just you i m talking about the overall radio there is no get lucky on the album and perhaps you know it s just because that just wasn t the song and maybe it could be that but it sounds like there s hits on that album to me but it sounds like this hits that is distracted by the statements fuck you and your corporation ya ll niggas can t control me on the first single yeah i mean this to me sounds like a radio hit where i m coming from but you said yourself back in the start you made a record that was built out of frustration and then you were trying to create cracks in the pavement i like that description more than you made an album for the radio hits as a kanye west fan i don t turn to your i never described it as an album for the radio hits no no no what i m saying like i preferred than you to describe it as cracks in the pavement than to have made a record just full the radio hits you know what i mean i want to hear where you are at pause that pause that that song is a hit song minus the line fuck you and your corporation ya ll niggas can t control me on your first single i think it s a great record but you ain t hearing what i am saying go ahead that song is a hit record minus fuck you and your corporation ya ll niggas can t control me said on your first single because if you can t control me then you can t control him then you can t control him then you can t control him and then the information age starts where it occurs while i was talking about starts where steve jobs has left as starts steve jobs made the internet usable this is the information age we barely scratched the surface yeah there is things that are moving the entire music industry was hit by a fucking glacier by the internet and sean parker just like that glacier up in there and steve was like no no wait a second come on give him a little time there won t be any music if you just give it away like that you know what i m saying but shit it s changing people are going to look at this interview and say hey i understand what he s talking about people are going to look at this interview and say i don t like kanye look he looks mad i don t like his teeth they re going to say why doesn t he just focus on music i liked him as music they re going to say hey i want the old kanye blah blah blah but one thing they will do they will play this interview in five years they will play this interview in ten years and say he called that he called that he called that he said that was going to happen that was going to change you re a futurist yeah i m a postmodernist as best as a career i m a futurist mentally talking about the internet where you feature into that obviously it s just a small part of the future and being a futurist it s not only just isn t aspect of it it s changed the way everything moves but it certainly with regards for music it s the biggest part it s our earth like you remember like that you see future movies and everything was in the sky like it moved to the sky that s where it is that s the internet right that s what it is that s our sky yeah that s our future sky we kind of thought we knew it was in its flying cars we didn t get flying cars but we can send movies like in two seconds yeah it s a very good point it s a very point yeah so you talk about it being in its early stages and it being really not even yet at a point where it s developed to its true potential i mean what are the key things that you ve learned in your journey i m fascinated to go down this road for a minute if you want yeah we could talk about this because i d love to yeah but while we hear this record is just the codes of that go listen to all my music it s the codes of self esteem it s the codes of who you are if you re a kanye west fan you are not a fan of me you re a fan of yourself you will believe in yourself i m just the expresso i m just the shot in the morning to get you going to make you believe that you could overcome that situation that you are dealing with all the time can i ask you a question about that yeah yeah i want to talk to you about that aspect of your personality because you said that you re not here to be talk about you you re here to help and i believe you when you say that man you know i think you know you ve given us great records you d like to think about where things are going to appear in the future you keep your eye on things you want to make like you said you want to make basketball tops for you if you re in high school you want to do things right yeah yeah do you allow yourself the time to be good to yourself do you allow yourself anytime for yourself at all do you know what i mean i know you ve got a good self esteem and who you are but you seem to be doing a lot for the bigger picture for everything that s moving around you yeah do you give yourself time yeah it s like family time yeah it s what kim gave me yeah she gave me everything she gave me a family she gave me a support system she was in a powerful enough situation where she could love me without asking me for money which is really hard for me to find yeah what are the some other things you know that you ve learned about yourself since you became a family man you know i can t pinpoint that i don t have the answer right on me i got to think about a little bit and give you a really good answer okay cool i ve got a lock and loaded amount of information that i like to express on a very wide scale that i ll give you but if you ask me a question like that i ll go back and think of it maybe i ll have an answer for you in a couple of days okay no problem no problem yeah when you get other outlets you can relax and give other outlets more breathing room meaning like okay when i did the coachella performance i had dancers on stage modern performance artists and i had this lift and i had the roman wall and i had like the celine shirt and above all this types so when jay told me to watch it i always say i didn t want to use dancers of course and i said that s fine because i was doing a fashion show in paris so i still had girls on the stage but you know i still had these elements of the emotion you must have been recognized that wasn t to through anything either i mean that was i mean this only what throwing was about that type of performance necessarily um what i m saying is it s about what i want to make it about this is my world but you re with jay on this start it is a collaborative project it s not just your vision on throwing yeah so then i would have to separate my world but still get to my world out to the fact that i had a fashion show you see i m saying so it s like right now people could say oh he is frustrated he is that he is that no all i need is the breakthrough the joint venture for of my clothing same as stella mccartney has same as i can name so many people they have joint ventures of backing to be able to express themselves that way okay bam i need that that outlet and then you ll get things closer to watch the throne you get things closer to bound because obviously people more people are adept to like blood on the leaves and bound and watch the throne it s just more of an overall like happier vibe right but jay is more realized than me meaning more of his dreams and hopes and aspirations from above has come true and hopefully god willing by the time i m his age that thing will happen for me also and i ll be in that place of a more zenned out place even it s like i couldn t have done this album without rick rubin i had to have a zen master come in and say okay this is just what we re going to do you don t realize i am so frustrated like i am so frustrated like i am so i ve got so much i want to give i ve got ideas on color palettes i ve got ideas on silhouettes and i ve got a million people telling me why i can t do it you know that i m not a real designer i m not this i m not a real rapper either i m not a real musician either like i don t know how to play the piano like i m a artist i went to art college i went to art college and was looked down like i m soft because i like wore like italian clothes you know i m saying when i m rapping in front of camera and my pant is tight trying to spit a verse for you know that s the same when i m sitting there you know like sitting there at a fashion show like i m there because i appreciate phoebe philo i appreciate raf simons i appreciate riccardo tisci and i look at them as my peers as creative people who dedicate their entire life to making something better for the world let me explain what anybody that knows a artist and you know someone that s giving that if you know artist there is only one thing you can say give or ask them when you see them there are two words thank you there is no why didn t you do this yo i want that what s up that no we dedicate our entire life to making our current time in civilization better to adding something to the culture and there is only two words that you can say thank you give us an insight to the fashion world though what you ve been going through there with that whole experience the biggest challenge you ve had clearly to get your vision across yeah yeah well be helping me is that partly and please don t take this the wrong way i just mean this in for the process of conversation is that partly do you think because some of the people who are making fashion look at you and they go well you say it yourself they dedicate their whole lives to one thing you are exceptionally successful and gifted in this area to move into the area it s understandable there is a human aspect of suspicion involved there because they are like well hang on a minute this is our life so what is it you are trying to achieve there do you think it plays a part of that what s going on do you think i ve dedicated the past years of my life to this i spent of my time working on this and of my time working on music why do you think this song niggas in paris is called niggas in paris because niggas was in paris because i had a office and a small courtyard across the street from colette where i couldn t even find a good pattern cutter that s why we were in paris i put in the hours i ve got a very particular specific take on men s footwear no one can say i cannot design or understand how to design a guy s sneaker when i was in fourth grade i was drawing jordans when my mama couldn t afford them i was drawing those jordans getting kicked out of class for drawing them and when i get that opportunity to work with nike i went to that emotional space and place of my life and said what was it about that what were the queues that i can add when i make the yeezy s you know i don t have to do interviews and i wasn t the one rapper that had the opportunity to do a shoe at nike for no reason it means it has to be another step it means it has to keep going people didn t love the yeezy s the way they did for no reason picture this for me to do the yeezy s and not have a joint venture backing deal with nike the next day would have been like if i made jesus walks i was never allowed to make a album if drake made his first mix tape and was never allowed to be signed if chainz only have and then people say why you mad do you know how many s chainz had in them he did features in one year yeah okay so let s features let s get to the solution kanye let s work out how are you going to kick that door in as well how are you going to get in to that world in you re way in your terms i m not trying to get into that world i m trying to make a higher level of product for the real world because people say life is unfair and unless you re kanye west you know this pretty girl that dates this soccer player or your parents had money you don t get to wear versace all the time and you hear it we love versace versace versace versace versace versace we love versace versace is the greatest designer of all time we love versace but unless you set a point or you rap so good and knock down so many doors to produce so much shit that you was able to actually get dame dash to give you a record deal because he was a producer not because he liked your raps because he was a producer this because dame knew it was up and he was downtown with the models and the artist and all that say yo look at you this kid got some talent you are not affording versace the creators they want to connect with people these artists the clothing is on as they want to connect with people the same way that music gets to connect with people but the fab the cost of silk is too expensive and they won t lower their quality level so i can spend million on a record and give it out at a democratic in a democratic way they could spend all their time making the greatest dress in the world and it s just impossible to hand make that many let me explain to you what a fashion office is like right sometimes if you are working on a album once it gets down to the last moment there is two or three people in the studio a engineer a manager the artist a label guy saying the masters to do tomorrow okay they do a day after tomorrow but let s get them in it narrows down to that at a fashion office you ve had people who have dedicated their entire life to this that are working people people interns coming in working till a m that night slaving to be able to put that thing on the run way pending things right before they go out all collections everyday for fashion month that is the level of dedication heart and soul that goes into that but what happens is for real people the democratic public the people who have a normal amount of money that work everyday that like nice things we ll just make these same cuts well by and provide this at a democratic cost the only thing about it that s different than nike and apple is there is never a time when someone can walk in with some non nikes and you feel less in yourself right you still feel like the greatest version of you right when you have those nikes on right but you can have on a zara pant right right and a girl walks in with the celine version and you feel like shit that is the problem that is the problem i mean obviously not my problem because i live like a yeah i mean i dress the same way i do it all the but i m talking about i m talkin about us the new slaves the people who love fashion i m talking about us you know because i m a slave to it i love it oh dude i can tell like i love it yeah i love it since age five when my mama brought me to a discount fur spot and she asked me what i like everything i liked was too expensive for us that s five years old i went to my grandfather s funeral like three weeks back and my cousin that works with me stood up and he told the story about you know how his mother was a tailor so he won best dress i worn best dress in the high school too a bunch of people in the lineage and my family worn best dress but his mother was a tailor right his mother was a tailor a black an african american tailor my grandfather was a hustler he used to take old vintage furniture and reupholster it then he had a store and he sold all of these different items that he thought would be good for people do you know how many times i sat with people and said hey i wanna make a store and he said how could you make a store blah blah blah it s in my code it s in my code have you all ever seen wreck it ralph yeah remember remember how that girl in there the people that was raising here were glitch yeah she was the glitch yeah you telling me they don t look at me like i m the motherfucking glitch you telling me people don t look at kanye west like the glitch right now and she was on the side of the video game the whole time it s in my code it s in my code i mean i watch what happens when you get on the mic or you get on stage and you say what you want to say and i don t want to refer this back to you comment about the glitch right and i watch people you know i see what some people say in comments and whatever after these things get posted and i go all right those are the people that think you re the glitch yeah they broke vanellope s car but but but vanellope von schweetz they broke her car yeah like but there is also a lot of people in the audience that love what you have to say love hearing what you have to say you know yeah appreciate what you have to say yeah do you focus on them as well yeah but i m doing it for everyone i m doing it for the people who don t appreciate it because they ll appreciate it later and of course i m doing it for the people who appreciate it if no one appreciate it i know there is couple of people up there to appreciate it for sure i appreciate it so and thank you very much and then people will say your voice was so strong why are you so focused on just clothing or why would you focus on just that award show or why will you focus on that the same reason why i sat there and focused on that otis beat you know people didn t like ham and miami heat was losing and i m in the mercer and i literally write on the screen who is watching the thrones and show a picture of the brownie stuff and i d say i got to watch up thrones and make odes right and say this i know niggas in paris doesn t work without odes you have to bring the flowers to the door first and we delivered odes and then we did this so wait a second that s just a step towards this because people could say what do you mean you want to help the world and you are so concerned about fashion it s illegal to be naked it s not illegal to not listen to music that is a very high opinion to have that is something that is extremely important shoes you put on shoes everyday you walking down the street with no shoes somebody might think there s something wrong with you sure you re walking down the street without a headphones it s like oh what s up how you are doing today no headphones today cool no music today what you did you know no shoes look man what s going on yeah you re having problems with the family is he okay wear your socks at least yeah sandals sandals yeah flip flops very rarely flip flops very rarely sandals with socks keep it gangster i mean i m from new zealand flip flops are far more standing yeah exactly but not for black dudes though no flip flops for black dudes i don t care where you at i don t care where you at no flip flop for black dudes wear some hot ass jordans on a beach dude we ve covered some stuff what about you now can you do me a favor like my brain is just like i walked into his house two more of the guys there sipping in man i hope i ll learn some stuff today my god i have no idea but would you indulge in me for five or minutes and would you let me just geek out on a music label because you know me yeah i love hearing what you have to say some of it i love some of it upsets me because as a fan i think you are too out on yourself but that s you that s who you are that s not for me to say yeah but what points do you think i m hard on myself well i think you expect a huge amount of yourself on every level as well you should and i think that you expect a huge amount of everybody else to understand your motives at all times oh no i don t expect to be understood at all okay but like i don t expect to be i think that there s people who are wired by their parents to understand what i m saying sure and there s people who are wired by their parents to reject what i m saying but that doesn t mean that after i make what i m saying that they won t use it because they will and i m just saying i want to make things i want to be able to make things and i m not going to be able to make things that i can call kanye west just by making t shirts at a certain point it has to connect i would not be here if it was not for a roc a fella chain if it wasn t for jay z s blessing and his co sign and his protection when i was in new york city dolo i would not be here in the way that i am through the category of the drug dealer filled rap game me as kanye west a young revolutionary coming out of chicago would have not made it as far without jay z being my big brother and watching my back at all times and this new place that i m going to and what i want to do it has to be someone that says because i m the thing is i m speaking to everybody but i m also speaking and sending queues to the right people to say come and help me help everybody else you will win with me you will win lets talk about the production side of things because you ve opened the door to collaboration in a big way on this record and even though you produced every song on this record you ve been very very open to the idea of working with all sorts of very talented individuals yeah have you enjoyed that aspect of it i mean in the past you know it hasn t necessarily been that much of a group mentality in making records it s the only way i can do it at this point i can t do it by myself i can t like i won t it is i have no interest in sitting down in the studio by myself and making a track when i made overnight celebrity which is great like i sat down there by myself and made it and there s people like yeah that s the answer make the music by yourself again ye we want the old ye but no i don t feel like doing that yeah i want to utilize the best resources that we have and have a conversation as you see i would rather have a conversation was throne a turning point for that because i felt i would throne there was a freedom there that didn t necessarily feel like you were carrying the whole thing on your own and also you are free to be an mc to be upfront and be a part of that process with jay and it wasn t like oh kanye the producer rapper or the whole encompassing thing did that began around that time yeah around it but dark fantasy though when we sowed that fabric so tight you know like for eight nine months pete rock and no i d and q tip everyone coming down to hawaii nicki minaj rick ross we like textured and jeff bhasker we created those textures collectively you know like i would be eating breakfast with ross in the morning and just come up with a line and stuff and we all go play ball and naz would come out there and play ball with me and common and stuff come up with another line then go there and then virgil will have a idea we say that and because its that communal process a lot of times you can t do it all on your own yeah you can t handle everything on your own hey how about us as a people we can t do it on our own that s true we have to understand that we re not each other s enemy we have to stop discriminating against each other due to class and due to race and due to location or financial position we have to say wow that is the best version lets use it lets bring it lets bring it to light lets move forward lets push forward as a civilization because we are so jacked up on our own egos and so misguided by mainstream marketing we don t know what the fuck is real we would be out again to a fight this quick for the dumbest reason definitely something that s like racially there is a gender set you know its like you know which is like we are pitted against each other we are mentally not in a place to be accepting to not be jealous and that part of that jealousy and that frustration that goes across an entire globe is due to some of these other high corporation level limitations everybody is being served a nasty lunch food like you know you heard the word minimalism a lot on this project yes of course even this is like you gave us what you need may not be what you want give us what we need to proceed not what we necessarily want because we can t be trusted to a certain extent you know yeah because we don t have the education yeah to know what to want yeah yeah we don t know what to want this is what i was telling that writer in nw i m learning what i want this is the reason why i m working at five architects in a time but that time that i m spending in a bad apartment i can t get that back and that education that i could get from working on it is priceless and there is very few people that are in the position to educate themselves as much as i can educate myself for me its constant information intake i hang around architects mostly yeah i want to talk about that side of things because i know that that s how you know that was that s been talked about in relation to this record as well and that blows my mind i mean for me i try and connect the dots to my favorite records as much as i can yeah but i need you to help me connect the dots and how architecture and how certain type of design that you surrounded yourself with walston paris has somehow manifested itself into this and how they are not separate things yeah it all parallels its like you know synesthesia seeing sounds it all parallels people will tell you this business inst like this business it s the same people every where you go the same type of guy you might meet in hollywood you might meet that same type of character in fashion you might meet that same type of character in music you got some straight up people to do it for the love and they want to promote it its all about that you got some people that s trying to like make their way its like lets just say its or ers and its like there s the ers the media for the most part the ers don t really know what it is and the ers that know what it is can t get it past the ers so this alone would be a beak this is a jump past this going to get taken off the internet quick send the paparazzi at him send the paparazzi at him lets do that get him locked up blah blah blah that s what s going to happen and paparazzi is going to come by me i m just standing like i know what you are trying to do right now sir i know exactly what you are trying to do somebody sent you at me somebody is trying to set me up somebody is trying to shut me up you know people will look at what is being going on with you and the cameras that s been going on with other people for a long time as well and i need you to help people who don t live your life and look at those magazines and there is millions and millions of people that do and look at those pictures who don t understand what it is that you go through in that situation what is it from your perspective you have got this platform you have used this to talk about a bunch of things so use it now to explain to them why is it what is it what is it like to go through that okay for me first of all dopeness is what i like the most dopeness people who want to make things as dope as possible and by default make money from it the thing i like the least are people who only want to make money from things whether they re dope or not and especially making money at making things as least dope as possible photography used to be a sexy profession it was like being a ball player like a rapper or like a venture capitalist or something like that right it was they used to get all the girls and everything like a photographer you go for a photographer studio like that they completely changed what photography is supposed to mean same is how there is like plenty of musicians that have sold the fuck out and change like the art and music where people don t hold that to the highest level of genius anymore meaning like if there s a high level artist like visual artist or a high level clothing artist they ll be held at a higher level of genius points than a musician because the things in music that are selling the most are the least inspired for the most part and the least genius so it confuses things so i take that to paparazzi it confuses it paparazzi is necessary not even a necessary evil it just needs to be legalized meaning at a certain point there s cutoff switches you know what time it is you know what is that like paparazzi currently like is understand give it rules give it boundaries yeah and obviously like publishing like because publishing like because they re selling our image and they re selling it in a bad way and if but let me get this straight what is offending you more the fact they are selling your image or the fact they are selling your image in a bad way in a bad way in a bad way a bad way and i m not getting paid for it right there you go so it s like the dopeness which makes the money i want the dopeness and the money yeah i m changing things for my daughter i m going to tell my daughter by the time she understands what it was man me and your mother were in a completely different situation than you re in at that time paparazzi wasn t legal people could take pictures people could climb over your fence people could do that you wouldn t even get paid for it you see all these checks that you re getting at age six because people taking your picture you don t have to worry about thing a thing ever again just because people want to take your picture like and i made that happen lowe that s what i m going to tell her so to be done oh i want to talk to you about control i want talk to you about the verse and control about kendrick verse and control because obviously he credited you he put you at the table where he rightfully should be with the m ms and the jay z s he put you on that side of the equation and then and then raddled off the list and i thought okay its great you deserved to be at the table but years ago if you hadn t been at the table and you had been on his list how do you think you would have reacted would you have been appreciative of his message or would you have come out swinging do you think and written a response yeah i don t diss records yeah yeah you are looking forward to two with him i mean that s an incredible double bill yeah its its i m just looking forward to the opportunity to speak to this brother as much as possible that those conversations is going to be more than everything i even say it right here because that he is one of our future messengers and i m going to give him them jewels let s talk about this track here which was the first track that we were given off this album to play on the radio which we did he said no singles but we ran with this one early and we proven to be right so just talk about this track here and who you worked with you worked with daft punk on this in part and how the song came together daft had the drums and i then just took the reck and i just started both this song i am a god and this song were made after hedi slimane didn t let me into his first saint laurent show but it wasn t that he wanted me to go but he just told me i couldn t go to any other shows other than that right right right right and i was like wait a second i can t go you re not telling no editor they can t go to any of these shows i m not your boy you can control me in some way so i made off of that i went into the studio with the producers that made the music for his show and made i am a god and black skinhead that was your reaction to that situation again that was my reaction that was the aspect of frustration you talked about that s important to this record yes yeah right on i mean just talking about another track on here as well new slaves which is one of my favorite songs on the record and you know its just as far as beats go its just remarkable before you even get stuck into the subject matter which is a whole other level i mean you know you are talking about the materialism about communist about corporations and everything else but at the same time you know there is a blurred line between whether or not you are part of it whether you are objecting to it or where it stands i mean just give us some insight into what this song is i m a part of it i m in it and i want to over come it sometimes i m the communicator of it some times i m the maker of it some times i m the consumer of it i m in it i m in the game but for me yeah i say i am a new slave you could be a slave to a lot of things at this point obviously i m a slave to my passion i m a slave to my mission it s funny you drive in a maybach past a homeless person and you ask who s more free you could be trapped to your possessions you got to do this next deal because you got to do this with your house and you got to get this car and you got to keep up everybody stay next to you last name is jones and you trying to keep up with all of them and that s what it s like to be a celebrity a lot times especially every rap is about how much money you make how many spends you get how many cars you got what house you get you know what house a rock got we like you know rappers and musicians trying to compete with ball players with way bigger contracts meanwhile the music is the titanic that s going down like this and everybody from the execs to the musicians are running around trying to see how they could still keep that certain house level that certain car level that certain thing up and of course for me i m blessed and i m blessed and i m privileged because i made such a powerful impact that i can make a certain amount on tour but also i m blessed and cursed by my level of education you know to be a visionary all you have to do is make decisions based off of your eyes instead of your ears and your memory i mean so at the moment of the mtv awards i made that decision based off of my eyes i was like that s not correct that is invalid completely invalid and everybody else don t move that s off they ears oh he going to get in trouble that s off they memory they don t move they re slaved they re slave to what could possibly happen we are constantly slaved there is glass ceilings there is glass fences there is invisible walls don t think i have not been many a times singing like five heart beats in paris i have been up there singing you want to diss one of my outfits don t want to say that don t want to like try to diss one of my girlfriends outfits blah blah we are just singing y all sing aintcha we can come out of that totally yea we sing aintcha sing something here and what do we sing we sing pyrex we sing beentrill we sing snapbacks we sing yeezus but we want to sing that nike we want that clean water i tasted and i see what it is like we want to sing louis vuitton we want to sing on a gucci level we want to sing as high as we could when we have pyramids we don t want to just have a little print on the back of our jacket that costs making us feel like a king again for a day we don t want to just have jewelry that s just trying to make us feel good we want to be good that s creation that s that thing that people slave over that s that thing that people are slaves to that s that thing that i m a slave to that s passion that s that thing where you can hold it that s that dreaming of a new pair of jordans that s the process of opening up a nike box that thing that steve gave us when you open up your new iphone and you got the iphone whether you stood in line for it or whatever it is you did or stuff but you open it up and you got this new product that s that transformers in a box that you open up for christmas or that new turbografx or sega genesis or amiga computer or a do or a nintendo or it s like when you just open that packaging the process of the packaging that s that porno mag that drug addict bought for you when you was that was in that package and you figured out how to pay that drug dealer before there was internet to buy you and you open up that and you know you are going to make of those your girlfriend all weekend that s why i m on that runway until i m at the end of it good

the door and right behind me here he is kanye west what up how are you i'm awesome i know you're doing a ton of interviews right now this is the first time you've been to amp radio so i have to say thank you okay awesome this is pretty major and i don't know you probably have no way of knowing this but the very first song i ever played on amp radio about four years ago was paranoid well thank you very much absolutely we're huge fans around here thank you i appreciate that thanks for coming in so what's the story behind all of a sudden we're seeing you in front of us because you haven't done a whole lot of these kinds of interviews but now here you are so we're thrilled to have you here you just feel like going out and saying hello yeah that's it that's awesome i dig that so you're out on the yeezus tour right now which first your album is awesome the live show sold out at staples on saturday night you got another one and then you've got anaheim on friday so tell me a little bit about what to expect at the tour stops because like i just told you before we went on the air i saw a little bit of the clips but i feel like it doesn't do it the justice of actually being there and experiencing the show in the moment yeah even if i explain it you know it's just like creativity central it's an example of like what donda can do that's my creative company it's an example of what happens when you put amazing thinkers in a room together and eliminate what they normally do and all the cliches that people slip into and challenge everyone in that room to come up with something completely new and that's what is completely new you know we we experiment with things and they get better and it's going to get better as it goes but if i have an idea i just do it i just go for it yeah that's cool there's a certain fearlessness about you which i really dig do you feel like you get crap for that a little bit the people misunderstand you yeah i'm not fearless i just have courage bravery like i have fear but i overcome my fear i know how to swim through backlash i know how to float i can tread water through backlash i don't care about backlash if anything because it's all given me power negative positive it's all energy and i can use energy what really inspires you i know you're really creative in so many different arenas but what do you look for what would spark you god number one inspiration god how can you get something to the you know the greatest he's the greatest creator of all time so if you're being creative my greatest inspiration is god he made our universe you know so you look that far and say if you gotta push hard to create on a more major scale nothing is more major then the creator he's given us the power of free will and the ability to create our own space right sometimes people say like it seems like you're not satisfied with just creating music well look at what howard hughes did look what david stern did look what steve jobs did look what da vinci did look what michelangelo did i have this platform now at age to really put out a lot a creative ideas certain people who are not giving me a shot or not backing me and i can meet with all the billionaires in the world and people just look at me like it's not me like i haven't created what i've created so i had to apologize to all the guys in the world for my engagement because i turned up so much on it but when you go on jimmy kimmel and say hey i'm a creative genius i don't think people really understood what i was talking about so let me make it so y'all can understand what i'm talking about when i say creative genius because that's my title do you think you're misunderstood in that aspect do you think people just take things the wrong way they just never heard it before they never tasted that flavor yet i just think it's awesome because you have a certain thing about you that you say what's on your mind and your true to yourself and i think a lot of people don't know what to do with that because they're not yeah and that's what is if i say hey i'm a creative genius i don't know any other way to explain what i do and the way i think up things and the way i have to fight to get ideas out had to fight to get my record deal i'm fighting to be able to make clothes i'm fighting to be able to make films it's mixing creativity with the fight like an athlete it's okay for athletes to fight and push it but they want the creative people to shut up and be quiet these are the people with the real ideas that can actually change can reorganize can design cities can restructure a curriculum can can make life easier you know that's the part of the game i wanna be in the making life more awesome because i'm so blessed i've had so many of my dreams come true i'm getting married to my dream girl i have a family i have good friends around me i've had some opportunities and what i realized is my greatest power so if you asked me a question before why am i coming why am i speaking i'm not a billionaire i may not be the richest person on the planet i might not be the most attractive guy i might not be the most liked but i right now because of new slaves and because of the position i've always taken have the most powerful voice by a mile and i'm going to use that i have a trillion dollars worth of voice and that's very very valuable so you're talking about you're influences with god and family and your life and enjoying life and i was thinking just how much your life has changed even in the past six months to a year and how much has that changed your daily does that mellow you out change your perspective on things i hang out wit my the girl and my daughter everyday there's no place i'd rather be so now even when i was thinking about the things i'm creating or the things i'm doing in business my biggest goal is to be able to get home to my family so even as i'm thinking about things i'm doing for the future it's like how can i set it up so i can just be my daughter's soccer coach how can i put myself in that position i can't imagine you showing up at the soccer game i just think that would be awesome i'm going to be a soccer coach like i'm going to design the uniforms i'm going to have to redesigned the minivan maybe maybe me and elon musk can design a new type of minivan a new kanye west mini van see that's a partnership you could get on board with right there well donda we want to create everything we have a perspective on things you see touch taste and feel just the quality of life we want to improve the quality of life it is a product experience and content company so a form of content could be yeezus that is a form of content experience could be the concert you went to a product could be the yeezy's those are examples of things that a collective of creative people have put together one thing i also want to stress is that the most genius thing about the way i create is to create with other geniuses to get out of their way it's not a matter of ego related to any ideas it's just who has the best idea we actually are really not ego based in any way these are things that people put up to confuse you or distract you from what it actually is at this point it's michael jordan time it's time to go six championships in and let people know this is what we're doing we're creating at the highest level i might not be the number one rockstar but i will be and create the number one creative company the post internet disney the post internet ralph lauren yo fuck you kanye first and foremost for making me

raise your glasses your glasses your glasses to the sky and here's to the roc this is the last call for alcohol for the mr rockefeller so get your ass up off the wall last call for alcohol for my niggas so this a r over at roc a fella named hip hop picked the truth beat for beanie and i was in the session with him i had my demo with me you know like i always do i play the songs he's like who that spittin i'm like it's me he's like oh well okay uhh he started talkin to me on the phone going back and forth just askin me to send him beats and i'm thinking he's trying to get into managing producers cause he had this other kid named just blaze he was messin with so won't you raise your glass won't you so won't you raise your glass won't you so won't you raise your glass won't you so won't you raise your glass won't you and um he was friends with my mentor no id and no id told him look man you wanna mess with kanye you need to tell him that you like the way he rap no id yo you wanna sign him tell him you like how he rap i was all i dunno if he was gassin' me or not but he's like he wanna manage me as a rapper and a producer i'm like oh shit i was messin with uh d dot also people were like this started talking about the ghost production but that's how i got in the game if it wasn't for that i wouldn't be here so you know after they picked that truth beat i was figuring i was gonna do some more work but shit just wasn't poppin off like that i was stayin in chicago i had my own apartment i be doin like just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on and then to go out and buy get a pelle pelle off lay away get some jordans or something or get a technomarine that's what we wore back then i made this one beat where i sped up this harold melvin sample i played it for hip over the phone he's like oh yo that shit is crazy jay might want it for this compilation album he doin called the dynasty and at that time like the drums really weren't soundin right to me so i went and um i was listening to dre chronic at that time and really i just like bit the drums off xxplosive and put it like with it sped up sampled and now it's kind of like my whole style when it started when he rapped on this can't be life and that was like really the first beat of that kind that was on the dynasty album i could say that was the the resurgence of the soul sound you know i got to come in and track the beat and at the time i was still with my other management i really wanted to roll with hip hop cause i i just needed some fresh air you know what i'm sayin cause i been there for a while i appreciated what they did for me but you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change try to move up to the next level and that day i came and i tracked the beat and i got to meet jay z and he said oh you a real soulful dude and he uh played the song cause he already spit his verse by the time i got to the studio you know how he do it one take and he said tell me what you think of this and i heard it and i was thinking like man i really wanted more like of the simple type jay z i ain't want like the the more introspective complicated rhy or the in my personal opinion so he asked me what you think of it and i was like man that shit tight you know what i'm sayin' man what i'ma tell him i was on the train man you know so after that i went back home and man i'm i'm just in chicago i'm trying to do my thing you know i got groups i got acts i'm trying to get on and like there wasn't nothin really like poppin' off the way it should have been one of my homies that was one of my artists he got signed but it was supposed to really go through my production company but he ended up going straight with the company so like i'm just straight holdin' the phone gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company and i got evicted at the same time so i went down and tracked the beats from him i took that money came back packed all my shit up in a u haul maybe about ten days before i had to actually get out so i ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk me and my mother drove to newark new jersey i hadn't even seen my apartment i remember i pulled up i unpacked all my shit you know we went to ikea i bought a bed i put the bed together myself i loaded up all my equipment and the first beat i made was uh heart of the city and beans was still working on his album at that time so i came up there to baseline it was beans' birthday matter of fact and i played like seven beats and you know i guess he was in the zone he already had the beats that he wanted i had did nothing like it already at that time but then jay walked in i remember he had a gucci bucket hat on i remember it like like it was yesterday and hiphop said yo play that one beat for him and i played heart of the city and really i made heart of the city i really wanted to give that beat to dmx and i played another beat and i played another beat and i remember that gucci bucket he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'ooooooooooh ' two days later i'm in baseline and i seen dame dame didn't know who i was and i was like yo what's up i'm kanye you that kid that gave all them beats to jay yo this nigga got classics to your beats you know i ain't talkin shit i'm like oh shit and all this time i'm starstruck man i'm still thinking 'bout you know i'm picturing these niggas on the show the streets is watching i'm lookin these were superstars in my eyes and they still are you know so jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day and in two days i gotta bring up one thing you know come back to the story the day i did the 'can't be life' beat on track i remember lenny s he had some louis vuitton sneakers on he think he fly and hip hop was there i think ty ty john meneilly a bunch of people i didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room and i said yo jay i could rap and i spit this rap that said uh i'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit mayonnaise colored benz i push miracle whips and i saw his eyes light up when i said that line but you know the rest the rap was like real wack and shit so that's all the response he said man that was tight that was it you know i ain't get no deal then hehe okay fast forward so blueprint h to the izzo my first hit single and i just took that proudly built relationships with people my relationship with kweli i think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper because you know of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him man i appre i love him for that and at this time you know i didn't have a deal i had songs and i had relationships with all these a r's and they wanted beats from me so they'd call me up i'd play them some beats gimme a beat that sound like jay z you know they dick riders whatever so i'll play them these post blueprint beats or whatever and then i'll play my shit i'll be like yo but i rap too hey i guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know cause i ain't have a jersey on or whatever everybody out there listen here i played them 'jesus walks' and they didn't sign me you know what happened it was some a r's that fucked with me though but then like the heads it'd be somebody at the company that'll say naw like dave lighty fucked with me my nigga mel brought me to a bunch of labels jessica rivera man i'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up let's just say i didn't get my deal the nigga that was behind me i mean he wasn't even a nigga you know the person who actually kicked everything off was joe h from capitol records he wanted to sign me really bad dame was like yo you got a deal with capitol okay man just make sure it's not wack then one day i just went ahead and played it i wanted to play some songs cause you know cam was in the room young guru and dame was in the room so i played actually it's a song that you'll never hear but maybe i might use it so it's called 'wow ' i go to jacob with thou you go with hundred wow i got eleven plaques on my walls right now you got your first gold single damn nigga wow like the chorus went don't bite that chorus i might still use it so i play that song for him and he's like oh shit i ain't gonna front it's kinda hot like they still weren't looking at me like a rapper and i'm sure dame figured 'like man if he do a whole album if his raps is wack at least we can throw cam on every song and save the album you know so uh dame took me into the office and he's like yo man b b you don't want a brick you don't want a brick you gotta be under an umbrella you'll get rained on i told hiphop and hiphop was all oh word actually even with that i was still about to take the deal with capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with h that you know cause i told him i was gonna do it and i'm a man of my word i was gonna roll with what i said i was gonna do then you know i'm not gonna name no names but people told me oh he's just a producer rapper and told h that told the heads of the capitol and right the day i'm talking about i planned out everything i was gonna do man i had picked out clothes i already started booking studio sessions i started arranging my album thinking of marketing schemes man i was ready to go and they had mel call me they said yo capitol pulled on the deal and you know i told them that roc a fella was interested and i don't know if they thought that was just something i was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever i went up i called g i said man you think we could still get that deal with roc a fella so won't you raise your glass won't you so won't you raise your glass won't you so won't you raise your glass won't you so won't you raise your glass won't you last night i dreamt of an angel i almost passed away you're yesterday but i'm blessed today on top of the world acts so painful it ain't no

box of x that make her tongue move faster than das efx uh white benz dyke twins i ain't gon' lie they only fives but together they tens and would i do them again hummm it's like old folks pissin' cause it all depends and there's no coke sniffin' just juice and gin grey goose will get you loose then hit the nigga producin' the track that got you movin' i never hit a lady but my game might abuse them buyin' boots just to tell 'em that i jimmy choose 'em and take 'em back to confuse 'em see she don't know if she's comin' or goin' cause mommy after i'm cummin' i'm goin' back to the show just frontin' and flowin' jewelry stuntin' and glowin' it's like somethin' outta nowhere yeah and i've been known to have a ho or two cause my diamond's yellow like a smoker tooth i tell 'em step into the

hoes that stay in marina del ray well paid they don't park it just valet waist small like the motorola cingular cell y voice high like mich'elle i step back like haha you ever ran for miss l a cause you holdin' down the city officia lly next time you fuckin' your man just yell k wait a second would you rather me not talk at all cause i don t want to like i don t want to rattle no cages or nothing i don t want to like i don t want to get in trouble i want to be scared i m trying my best to be scared i m trying my hardest to be scared no no no i don t want to talk i don t want to talk at all as a matter of fact i m just going to tip toe on this i m scared of anonymous comments online i m scared of them these words affect me so much they affect me so much no i m sorry i m scared i m scared i m scared of these corporations like not giving me another deal that they didn t give me already i m scared i m scared i m so shook i m so so scared so scared soooo you ain t never seen you ain t ever seen that my great great great granddaddy somehow ended up on that boat somehow he ended up on that boat but i know that we were royalty i know we built the pyramids i know anything is possible i know anything is possible and everybody has a moment in time and i picked y all when i was walking in madison square garden i just wanted to make sure thank y all for giving me this moment in time cause everybody has a moment and in your moment you gotta own it there s so many people have a moment and they don t own it you know it s so funny when people compliment me and they say the word genius and somehow that like separates me from rappers in some way there s the connotation of that but what i need y all to realize is jay z is a genius and i need y all to understand that drake is a genius i need y all to understand that rap is an amazing way to express genius cause just as an architect would build buildings we put our words together to express the shit that we going through we are the modern day poets obviously but why are so many writers so condescending to the rappers why do they try to classify us as musicians as being ignorant in some way why do they try to classify us as far as the classes go you know how it goes right i think it s like a battle between art and architecture as the top and if you re an artist or an architect you look down upon a fashion designer and if you re a fashion designer you look down upon a musician and if you a musician you sign a deal with a corporation so you can buy a bigger house and every time you go in the studio you watch your fucking mouth you watch you watch your fucking mouth you don t you don t want to lose this house but when they write these history books they re not going to talk about what house we had when they write the history books they aren t going to talk about the money we made they re going to talk about the impact we had they re going to talk about the impact we had and being that i saw the hunger games today i wanted to bring up something because it was very inspiring it felt like almost a mimic of my exact life and shit i know it i was like baby we gotta be on that movie board when they writing this shit and i saw lenny kravitz there wouldn t be no song called niggas in paris if it wasn t for lenny kravitz cause that was the first nigga in paris fucking with the models and shit rocking rick owens head to toe and shit black rock star but what s interesting to me is like i was fond of hanging out with different people in paris right cause lenny kravitz has like the best taste and he has like the dopest crib in paris everybody knows about it and i don t know if you know this but he designs furniture he designs lighting fixtures and he had been working on a clothing line for a long long long long long long long time long time long long long long time and the designers would love it when lenny kravitz would show up at their fashion show yeah we gonna take some pictures of lenny kravitz and we gonna say he s at the such and such show and that s gonna promote our brand hey lenny promote it the best you can hey lenny promote it the best you can hey lenny promote it the best you can best you can hey kanye promote it the best you can hey kanye promote us the best you can from paris to new york all the way to japan hey kanye i mean lenny i mean any of you niggas promote it the best you can any of you niggas promote if the best you can so i said wait a second though i said i ve got a dream of doing my clothing and i i want to learn about furniture and you know what they told me when i was in paris you know when the w magazine writer came out and wrote that classist ass interview about me you know what they said you know what the billionaires told me i went to about three or four different people and you know what they told me when i told them about my dreams they said lenny kravitz wanted the same same thing they said lenny kravitz wanted the same same thing don t let me sing because i want y all to understand that i need to talk to you they told me hey that s cute that s the same thing lenny wanted to do like it s a motherfucking joke it wouldn t be no kanye west if it wasn t for lenny kravitz you know what i m saying but the only difference between me and lenny kravitz is i turned up on these niggas i don t give a fuck about looking cool or being cool and this is no disrespect to lenny but they got this shit called cool everybody want to look cool everybody want to be cool everybody don t want to break their motherfucking cool don t nobody want to look like a fool my boy who used to work for donda and now designs stages for jay z and justin the other day he said a word that i hadn t heard people say before and he said he was working at some corporation and the head of the corporation is always like kind of down on him and shit and the word was to marginalize to marginalize and then he also said he tried to make him look like an idiot in front of people right so has anyone here tonight ever read a piece of press or saw something or heard something on the radio where they tried to make me look like an idiot wait a second i don t know have you ever heard anything in the press where they re trying to make me look stupid you know what i m saying like i m actually stupid laughs you know what i m saying like i m not smart like stupid like like what the fuck is wrong with him you know what i m saying have y all ever read or heard someone say i don t like kanye west i ll tell you something have you ever heard anyone talk shit about lenny kravitz though he s a nice guy he s a nice guy he s so well mannered i envy manners i envy it i envy people who are extremely likeable i m like damn i wish i could be likeable like them i wish people would like me like that so what they basically did was at fashion week let me explain something to you i don t give a fuck about fashion i care about talent i care about creativity and it just so happens that with the advent of the louis vuitton bag fashion rise to the top and stole all of the creativity to only work for its small box and sell it back to you at a higher price that s what the fuck fashion is to me i care about dreamers i care about heart i care about soul not those who are marginalized so if you think about someone like mcqueen instead of being forced to make some fucking t shirts with a skull on it why wasn t he allowed to make movies he was just as good as tarsem he s just a good a visualist as anyone else but they would marginalize him as only a fashion designer which let s rewind is above a music producer and it s above a rapper cause you gotta stay in your tier in your section you gotta stay right there you can t move but if you pay for a ticket you wanted to come to see this show and you standing right there right and when you re trying to go you say i want to go up there a security guard stops you and then holds you and if you start screaming the paparazzi catch you catch you with your face looking all crazy and then you scream out loud and you got to really scream you gotta say i am a god just for them to let you a little bit up but you know who fucked it up for everyone marc jacobs because he gave two niggas a shot me and pharrell he fucked the whole game up and pharell s such a nice guy cause soon as i was able to make that louis vuitton sneaker and the world reacted i didn t price it but the world reacted to it i got to see what it meant to create inside of that type of production facility and wait a second the same guy that was creative enough to make all of this that s worn jordans his whole life could create a sneaker with louis vuitton and people reacted to that and i said i made another color i did a pink model and i did a red model and i named them after my friends i made one in jasper after ivan jasper and one mr hudson after mr hudson and one the louis vuitton don for my nigga don c and that last day in the factory i was going through the colors and it came to me when they made me do a couple pictures and shit and i called back after they sold out and they said i m sorry mr west but you re not going to be able to create anything else in here you re not going to be able to create anything else again they said i m sorry and i said but wait a second i sold out they said i m sorry mr west you can never create anything else again and right there i was scared right there i was scared cause i thought that if i just went to their fashion show again and i just sat down like a good nigga they would let lenny kravitz get his shot i thought maybe maybe they would let pharell get his shot but no no no fuck you nigga fuck you nigga fuck you nigga is that abrasive enough for you cause that s what it is fuck you nigga is that abrasive enough for you and what about mark parker and what about hedi slimane i thought hedi slimane was my friend and that s why i m so hurt how many names did people call me for wearing tight jeans when i m the rapper that wore tight jeans and shit that brought tight jeans to the ghetto and shit i thought i was hedi slimane designing motherfuckin tight jeans that you want i m the nigga that you know i m rocking that shit then he had his first fashion show and i was so happy for him i was so so so happy for him and he told me you can come to my show but you just can t go to riccardo s show and you can t go to phoebe s show but he wouldn t say that to anna wintour he wouldn t say that to and now his whole shit based off of rock and roll and you trying to tell the number one rock star on the planet where the fuck he can go so he can sell y all some motherfucking pair of jeans fuck fashion fuck fashion i mean what s the worst thing they gonna do not help me again what s the worst they gonna do tell me i can t go to these shows again what s the worst they gonna do tell me that because i m a musician i don t have any ideas for clothing again what s the worst they gonna do marginalize me again and never let pharrell get his shot and never let lenny get his shot but i mma tell y all right now i will take that spot i am pac of this clothing shit and i mma take that spot and we gonna combine all the creators the best creators on the planet and we gonna lower the motherfucking prices so everybody can get it and we ain t gonna steal from people s ideas like h m and we ain t gonna steal people s ideas like zara we gon make our own shit we gon combine the best creators on the planet and we gon take them from harvard and we gon take them from st mark's and we gon take em from the street and i m sorry i went so long tonight i know you just want to hear another motherfuckin hit song tonight i m so sorry i went so long tonight i know you just want to hear another motherfuckin hit song tonight hit song tonight hit song tonight another hit song another hit song yes they do i ask people about it i tell them that i m this creator and they say

first of all thank you taylor for being so gracious and giving me this award this evening thank you and i can think back to the first day i met you also you know i think about when i m in the grocery store with my daughter and i have a really great conversation about fresh juice and you know and at the end they say oh you re not that bad after all and like i think about it sometimes like it crosses my mind a bit like when i go to a baseball game and um sixty thousand people boo me crosses my mind a little bit and i think if i had to do it all again what would i have done would i have worn a leather shirt would i have drank a half a bottle of hennessy and gave the rest of it to the audience y all know y all drink that bottle too if i had a daughter at that time would i have went on stage and grab the mic from someone else's you know this arena tomorrow it s gonna be a completely different set up some concert something like that this stage will be gone after that night the stage is gone but the effect that it had on people remain the the problem was the contradiction the contradiction is i do fight for artists but in that fight i somehow was disrespectful to artists i i didn t know how to say the right thing the perfect thing i just i sat at the grammy s and saw justin timberlake and cee lo lose gnarls barkley and the future love sexyback album and bro justin i ain t tryna put you on blast but i saw that man in tears bro you know and i was thinking like he deserve to win album of the year and this small box that we are as the entertainers of the evening how could you explain that sometimes i feel like you know all this shit they run about beef and that sometimes i feel like i died for an artist's opinion for an artist to be able to have an opinion after they were successful i m not no politician bro and look at that you know how many times mtv ran that footage again cause it got them more ratings you know how many times they announced taylor was gonna give me the award cause it got them more ratings listen to the kids bro i still don t understand award shows i don t understand how they get five people who work their entire life won sold records sold concert tickets to come stand on a carpet and for the first time in they live be judged on a chopping block and have the opportunity to be considered a loser i don t understand it bro i don t understand when the biggest album or the biggest video i still don t understand it i been conflicted bro i just wanted people to like me more but fuck that bro two thousand and fifteen i will die for the art for what i believe in and the art ain't always gonna be polite y all might be thinking right now i wonder did he smoke something before he came up here the answer is yes i rolled up a little something i knocked the edge off i don t know what s gonna happen tonight i don t know what's going to happen tomorrow bro but all i can say to my artists my fellow artists just worry how you feel at the time man just worry about how you feel and don t never you know what i m saying i m confident i believe in myself we the millennials bro this is a new this is a new mentality we not gonna control our kids with brands we re not gonna teach low self esteem and hate to our kids we re gonna teach our kids that they can be something we gonna teach our kids that they can stand up for themselves we gonna teach our kids to believe in themselves if my grandfather was here right now he would not let me back down i don t know what i m finna lose after this it don t matter though it ain t about me it

out on everybody who doesn t want to give me my credit and you know you hit your shots yeah you put me on the team so i m going to use my platform to tell people that they re not being fair anytime i ve had a big thing that s ever pierced and cut across the internet it was a fight for justice justice and when you say justice it doesn t have to be war justice could just be clearing a path for people to dream properly it could be clearing a path to make it fair within the arena that i play you know if michael jordan can scream at the refs me as kanye west as the michael jordan of music can go and say this is wrong you ve won a lot of grammys fantasy and watch the throne neither was nominated for album of the year and i made both of those in one year i don t know if this is statistically right but i m assuming i have the most grammys of anyone my age but i haven t won one against a white person but the thing is i don t care about the grammys i just would like for the statistics to be more accurate you want the historical record to be right lost for album of the year and i looked at justin and i was like do you want me to go onstage for you you know do you want me to fight for you for what s right i am so credible and so influential and so relevant that i will change things so when the next little girl that wants to be you know a musician and give up her anonymity and her voice to express her talent and bring something special to the world and it s time for us to roll out and say did this person have the biggest thing of the year that thing is more fair because i was there but has that instinct led you astray like the taylor swift interruption at the mtv video music awards things like that it s only led me to complete awesomeness at all times it s only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness beauty truth awesomeness that s all it is so no regrets i don t have one regret do you believe in the concept of regret if anyone s reading this waiting for some type of full on flat apology for anything they should just stop reading right now but that is something that you apologized for yeah i think that i have like faltered you know as a human my message isn t perfectly defined i have as a human being fallen to peer pressure that s fascinating to look at that record through that lens does that make dark fantasy a dishonest album in some way it s always going to be percent at least what i want to give and percent fulfilling a perception if you walk into an old man s house they re not giving nothing they re at percent exactly what they want to do i would hear stories about steve jobs and feel like he was at percent exactly what he wanted to do but i m sure even a steve jobs has compromised even a rick owens has compromised you know even a kanye west has compromised sometimes you don t even know when you re being compromised till after the fact and that s what you regret i don t want to come off dissing dark fantasy it s me never being satisfied and then me coming and admitting and saying the truth as much as i can air things out for other people to air things out for myself to say i feel like this could ve been stronger even though you had always wanted to be out in front was there ever a point where you valued your anonymity and i would go there and just go up the escalator and say to myself i m soaking in these last moments of anonymity i knew i was going to make it this far i knew that this was going to happen but producting happened for you first especially after jay z used you so heavily on the blueprint kweli they helped to get out of me i was able to put it sloppily rap it on top of the platform that jay z had created for me before when i wanted to rap my raps sounded like a bit like cam ron they sounded a bit like mase they sounded a bit like jay z or whoever and it wasn t until i hung out with dead prez and understood how to make you know raps with a message sound cool that i was able to just write all falls down in minutes is that true yeah that s how i discovered my style i was just hanging out with them all the time in new york i would produce for them you know i was able to slip past everything with a pink polo but i am dead prez and now because i was able to slip past i have a responsibility at all times what were the things that you were trying to do on late registration that you either did not or could not yet do on dropout i was trying to do different things with orchestras it was just a vibe that i was trying to get at a sound i was trying to mix with hip hop to try to see how far i could expand it i guess that was a chicago thing like quincy jones i really liked the sound of some projects that jon brion had worked on i was always considered this crazy hothead kid but i would always just go and just really break bread with someone who i respected i will completely bow to anybody i respect that era also includes what i find probably the most moving thing that you ve ever done which is calling out president bush at the hurricane katrina telethon to me that moment is actually the peak of putting a message in a pop format even though it s not a song yeah i guess it s a very pop moment of a lifetime or generation i mean my dad s generation is a generation of messaging you know but that s just a piece of me being the opinionated individual that i am were you conscious that that s what you were doing or was it totally just instinct yeah it was pretty bugged out when you think about it i was wearing like a juicy couture men s polo shirt we weren t there like ready for war you look at jay or diddy and i d say like percent of the time you think they re having a good time with you i would say i don t know maybe or maybe percent of the time it looks like i m not having a good time but you re in a very public relationship a seemingly long and satisfying relationship you re about to have a child any woman that you re in love with or that loves you is going to command a certain amount of you know energy it s actually easier to focus in some ways when you re uncertain about love it can be such a distraction it infects all the other areas yeah that s what i mean when i say like yo i m going to be super zenned out like five years from now i m the type of rock star that likes to have a girlfriend you know i m the type of soul that likes to be in love and likes to be able to focus and that inspires me on keeping up with the kardashians there s a really affectionate scene where you go and help kim sort through her clothes that was from a place of love it s hard when people read things in a lot of different ways you know the amount of backlash i got from it is when i decided to not be on the show anymore and it s not that i have an issue with the show i just have an issue with the amount of backlash that i get because i just see like an amazing person that i m in love with that i want to help one of the things i thought when i heard the new record was this is the anti 'college dropout it feels like you re shedding skin back then you were like i want more sounds i want more complicated raps i want all the things at what point did that change because i would always think about def jam his records did used to say reduced by rick rubin for him it s really just inside of him i m still just a kid learning about minimalism and he s a master of it it s just really such a blessing to be able to work with him i want to say that after working with rick it humbled me to realize why i hadn t even though i produced watch the throne even though i produced dark fantasy why i hadn t won album of the year yet this album is moments that i haven t done before like just my voice and drums what people call a rant but put it next to just a drumbeat and it cuts to the level of like run d m c or krs one the last record i can remember and i m going to name records that you ll think are cheesy but like j kwon tipsy people would think that s like a lower quality less intellectual form of hip hop but that s always my no there s no opera sounds on this new album you know what i mean it s just like super low bit i m still like slightly a snob but i completely removed my snob heaven songs i just removed them altogether man i can understand how it might be kinda hard to love a girl like me i don't blame you much for wanting to be free i just wanted you to know good god midwest coast back nigga and don't say 'nigga' unless of course you black nigga free country they say that shit in tennessee 'cause i got all their white daughters

right take you places i know you like i could make you a celebrity overnight i ll take one question i wanted to vibe off an idea and then i can riff off of that they said i ve got minutes or so i might go longer ok everyone please be completely quiet because i can literally hear a whisper and it ll throw off my stream of consciousness and when i get my stream of consciousness going that s when i give the best illest quotes literally a whisper can throw it off today was the first time i realised if i could have done it again i would have gone to the art institute over the american academy of art i would have researched where i could have got the best and the strongest education and i m sure this will end up online so i don t want to diss anyone at the american academy i m sure it s equal to the art institute of chicago by now but at the time i was going i would look around at the work of the class and not feel inspired by the teachers and i kinda the idea of being a fine artist that s a really difficult profession to get into to be respected in to make money at maybe the goal for some of the people was just to work at an advertising agency or at a record label my goal if i was going to do art fine art would have been to become picasso or greater that always sounds so funny to people comparing yourself to someone in the past that has done so much and in your life you re not even allowed to think that you can do as much that s a mentality that suppresses humanity some of you here probably remember the night when the donda tweets came through me and i started talking about professions that you guys are going into that seemed they had nothing to do with a rapper i was talking about a band of thinkers that could remove religion race gender and somehow come together to find solutions for a broken planet we have the resources as a civilization to find a utopia but we re led by the most greedy and the least noble what i notice about creatives is that and one of the reasons why i get into trouble is not only do i want to design video games or make music or ride bikes i think one of the most important things to my ability to create so much in the past years is my desire to play sports i approach creativity like a sport where if i have a drawing i react just like a jock look at the fucking drawing right there yeah we re all creatives here we re all born artists some people are artists of business some people are artists of composition we were taught to hide our black fingernail polish and put our head down in the back of the class and not notice out of fear that someone might laugh at one of our ideas that our idea could become a mockery or a failure in some way there s a bible saying no weapon formed against me shall prosper recently i ve been doing interviews and i ve had to go back to this verse because i don t think there s a living celebrity with more weapons formed against them but i also don t think there s one more prosperous so what weapons have prospered the smoke and mirrors of other opinions i was sitting with steve mcqueen he shot the visuals for all day two days ago it s completely different to the brit awards so it doesn t get taken out of context i m going to use the word like i m not saying it is i m using it as a comparison so people that want to say kanye goes to oxford and tells everyone blah blah blah and i m not telling you this i m telling you what i told steve mcqueen in private what i said was the matrix is like the bible of the post information age i compared it like when the hundred guys come at neo those are opinions that s perception that s tradition attacking people from every which angle possible if you have a focus wide and master senses like laurence fishburne and you have a squad behind you you literally can put the world in slow motion it s still february right security guard shakes his head everyone laughs by the way i don t know the days of the week i just go to exactly when my appointment is we d just look at each other and say it s still february for the sheer mount of work that we were able to put into the world some of the stuff had been worked on for years coming months coming but nonetheless they came back to back to back to back answering every crazy interview question blocking every shot catching every rebound aside from the right i don t have to give my opinion publicly about artists i probably would have been batting i know that s incorrect also this humanity that i talk about this civilization that i talk about this future utopia i talk about it can only happen through collaboration i love steve jobs he s my favorite person but there s one thing that disappoints me when steve passed he didn t give the ideas up that s kinda selfish you know that elon s like yeah take these ideas maybe there are companies outside of apple that could work on them and push humanity forward maybe the stock brokers won t like that the stock holders wouldn t like that idea but ideas are free and you can t be selfish with them i think that progression of mind with the advent of a human being named drake laughs smirks crowd laughs you know this idea of holding onto a number spot and then you get this guy that comes and blows out the water every number of any band ever be it me or paul mccartney i understand that i m a servant and with my voice with my ability to build relationships with amazing people speak to amazing people call elon musk out of the blue or call obama out of the blue he calls the home phone by the way with that i have a responsibility to serve why do i say the matrix is like the bible what is my definition of the matrix i work with an artist called vanessa beecroft and she bought my daughter some toys i d see toys that some people would buy for my daughter and i d say this toy isn t quality i don t want my daughter playing with this there s not enough love put into this this is just manufactured with the will to sell and not the will of inspiration vanessa is very focused she s like my eyes she s a piece of my brain she bought my daughter these three wolves knowing the whole collection that it d play with the song wolves and based on this concept and when my daughter saw these wolves i ve never seen her so happy she was going so crazy she was grabbing one she was riding on top of one i ve never seen her happier than this moment that level of happiness seems to be the thing that we re fighting for every day that we re trying to buy back trying to work for especially in america in america people really do wear shirts for real here and in stockholm people will be like oh dude it s a shirt i m assuming i m probably wearing a shirt but i got it for free from the designer so we ve been sold a concept of joy through advertising through car advertising through fashion branding it s not the concept of time time with your family time with your friends the little time that we do have on earth and what we do with that it was somehow sold to us through a gucci bag or something time is the only luxury it s the only thing you can t get back if you lose your luggage i m not gonna say the obvious brand of luggage that i d normally say because i ve got a meeting with them soon if you lose your expensive luggage at the airport you can get that back you can t get the time back it feels like people do everything in life to get this bmw this benz to get this townhome to get kids exactly one of them has to be small y know and you re looking for this moment where you sit in your bmw after all the work you ve done and all the accolades you get and you somehow think you re gonna get that level of joy that my daughter had when she received those wolves and when you re sitting in traffic in your bmw it s something that feels empty to everyone who reaches that point this concept of the selfish human this idea of separation by race or gender or religion or age or my favourite thing to hate class people say it takes a village to raise a child people ask me how my daughter is doing she s only doing good if your daughter s doing good we re all one family we have the ability to approach our race like ants or we have the ability to approach our race like crabs this is a generation that is far less racist yes small remnants remain of even thinking of calling something of a racial slur white people that listen to rap say nigger in the privacy of their own home that idea has passed we ve had the cosby show obama s president beyonce s great that s passed but there s still something you re taught every day especially in the uk and that s division by class our main focus in my opinion imagine a world with no war and imagine if everyone s main focus more so than going out to a club their main focus was to help someone else i was joking with an interviewer earlier today people talk about the number of viewers the brits get or the number of viewers the grammys get they need to do award shows for the nobel peace prize but i guess that doesn t sell as many mastercard commercials oh i mentioned a brand i had two things i was trying to get a flawless victory on my speech no offence to mastercard but that was a big fucking logo in the middle you guys have been taught without you knowing ways to separate yourselves from each other if you re separated you can be easily controlled if you re too busy pointing fingers at each other rather than holding hands you can t get anything done you know chris rock called my album my beautiful dark twisted fantasy well chris rock and everyone else at every single media publication called my beautiful dark twisted fantasy the best album of the last years this only came through collaboration one of the most memorable things about mbdtf was nicki minaj and the fact that she kicked my ass on my own song on one of the best albums the best album i m just saying what the critics said of the last years the best album of the past years that i spent a year and a half making out there i was exiled from my country it was a personal exile but exile to come back and deliver my magnum opus of a work and to be outshined to be beat by a girl basically this was necessary i think it was one of the most important points of working on that album was to not stop her from her moment because of how good she is just think of a comparison if you think about why did it take so long for the new yeezys to come out why did i have to leave one group and go to another group why did that group not want to speak to me i think the yeezys i was doing over there were comparable to that nicki minaj verse because these guys were like we re worrying about this shoe we re gonna put it on this celebrity and the head s son would come and say my favourite shoe is the yeezy and it s like ahhh i can t hear about these yeezys anymore like everyone talking about nicki s verse i can t hear about this verse anymore it was gonna work for her anyway but let s just say that in some way in helped give her exposure she was able to go on and become a successful and fly and run and dream and provide and it was not locked because of my career one of my biggest achilles heels has been my ego and if i kanye west the very person can remove my ego i think there s hope for everyone when i talk about collaboration and the creative process the best idea wins i m proud of the consistency of the performances i ve done since i ve been out here and it comes from four would be egomaniacs coming out and being forced to work together the best lighting guy on the planet the best staging guy the best video guy another staging guy a guy with a laptop for no reason to be able to deliver back to back to back extremely successful inspiring groundbreaking visual visceral creative moments that otherwise would have been challenged and the kid from chicago screaming from the top of the stage for minutes in a row i ve had to pull that card out a few times not particularly screaming but remember i will scream my momma taught me that if i was in a grocery store and i m by myself and a stranger grabbed my hand scream at the top of your fucking lungs if i m at an awards show and a stranger grabs my hand and they say so we re going to use these moving lights or we re gonna play the music right now before we define the look or we re gonna cut the tv cameras in a traditional way i ll scream at the top of my fucking lungs people say i have a bad reputation i think i ve got the best reputation in the building they want you to have a reputation of tucking your black nail polish into your pockets and sitting in the corner of the class and not fighting for your ideas out of fear of being ridiculed that s one of my favourite ones to be called crazy i remember when i was young and saw my dad working on computers and the guy he was working with ended up being a bad guy and the guys that helped him that he had the voice to find didn t have the same motivation a high enough skill set to match up to his vision to his dream for it to be considered to be a success but the success is that his successor will be successful in his lifetime you could say but you are successful i m successful in learning about the beauty that is afforded to rich people but in learning that being brought up middle class it s something that is beating out of my chest wait a second i was middle class and i didn t get to see none of this shit let s have an nbc telethon moment and say that beauty has been stolen from the people and is being sold back to them under the concept of luxury it s illegal to not wear clothes and also possibly too cold that means someone is imposing an idea on you that should legally have to do clothing should be like food there should never be a sweater you know what should cost a car should be and you know who should work on the car the people that work on the cars all the best talent in the world needs to work for the people and i am so fucking serious about this concept that i will stand in front of anyone and fight for it because i was and middle class i know what it felt like to not get what i have people say to me you re successful what are you crying about i m crying about the people i m crying about their daughters our daughters as one family what good is it what good is anything that everyone can t have every ism they think we re done with racism what about elitism what about separatism what about classism that s all she really thought that yeah yeah she s so paranoid yeah that s good paranoid girl's gonna

hispanics jews and asians could put their foot in the door yes we know that this man is great that's why today we celebrate everyone lifts their voice and sing for a man who wanted freedom to ring martin luther king is who i'm speaking of a man whose name means love react how you want any energy you got is good energy you know the confederate flag represented slavery that s my abstract take on what i know about it so i made the song new slaves so i took the confederate flag and made it my flag it s my flag now now whatchu gonna do it looks cool i like at maybe images a day you know i ve been working on clothing seriously for the past years it s colorless also it s super like hood and super white boy approved at the same time and that s really what my style s always been because i lived in the suburbs where you know i was known as the black kid and i lived in the hood where i was known as the kid who spent his summers in the suburbs my dad was a military brat and he would be around white people back then when it was like racism was really popular and people would be racist against him and he d get around black people and they d kinda discriminate against him because they d say he acted white or talked white so there are times when i ll talk and you ll hear some of that white or what people call white the suburb voice come through and it s times you ll hear some of

saint pablo tour is the most relevant shit happening the saint pablo tour is more relevant than radio and if y all keep following old models your ass is going to be hillary clinton you might not like it but they gotta hear it i ain t here to massage you with a fake truth telling you that hillary gon win over and over and over and then you wake up you still can t believe it you know why because you was lied to by google you was lied to by mark zuckerberg mark zuckerberg you wanna call me now do i got the vision mark zuckerberg was you wrong when i said i was million in debt and you didn t call me was you wrong you ate dinner you asked my friend ebony schiller to have dinner with me i told you about donda you said you would help and you didn t then you went to look for aliens me and kid cudi are aliens right here bro the vibes is back take it all the way back to the beginning shia labeouf kid cudi feels a way give him a call q tip i love you bro don t tell me how to be me though i love you the tribe album is dope i love you don t tell me how to be me though i ve been me i am me there s a richard pryor interview that you can watch about people coming into power and not changing everything and just becoming a part of the power that s happened with musicians because they re scared i m not scared i m here to change things i am here to change things and things won t change until people admit their own falsehoods i got the visions bro that s what i ve been blessed with my vision i m not always going to say things the perfect way the right way but i m going to say how i feel right now press get ready to write your passive aggressive lebron james racist comments season racist comments get ready to have a field day press get ready get ready because the show s over trump vote i'll say something that is kinda politically correct but i told y all i didn t vote right but if i would ve voted i would ve voted on trump thank you that s a woman right there saying i love you after i just said that there was things that i liked about trump s campaign that s not supposed to happen right case in point i guess we re just not gonna sell out the rest of the tour now there s nonpolitical methods to speaking that i like that i feel were very futuristic and that style and that method of communication has proven that it can beat a politically correct way of communication and i fuck with that i don t say out of disrespect to our president at all i m not saying that oh man that just mean that anybody can win that s not what i m saying when i say i just said i got some ideas about the way we should connect our ideas and we should use opposite parties that the republicans that the democrats that everyone that ran that had an idea that people agreed with should be the collective ideas that are used to run the country and that should mean more so there s things that benjamin carson believes in that i believe in i think that benjamin carson should still be a consultant i think that hillary clinton should still be a consultant i think that bill clinton should still be a consultant i think obama should still be a consultant instead oh i don t fuck with your principles so now i m not gonna give you no information that can help you help all of us i m not saying this to diss celebrities at all particularly on the democratic side that s cool i just hate the fact that because i m a celebrity everybody told me not to say that i loved the debates i loved his approach it be like white people that s racist running around saying nigga now racism if people are racist and they feel more inspired to say how they feel then they re exposing themselves bro this is what i m saying it s already the beginning of change sometimes things that you might think are bad need to happen in order for change to fucking happen sometimes you might have to not get your way to really understand what to do in the future to be able to get your way specifically to black people stop focusing on racism this world is racist ok let s stop being distracted to focus on that as much it s just a fucking fact we are in a racist country period do not allow people to make us talk about that so fucking long let s talk about whatever the fuck you wanna talk about let s stop talking about that bro it s racist ok and not one or the other candidate was gonna instantly be able to change that because of their views bottom fucking line education not based on a s idea of how to put everyone in the same factory schools were designed to put people in certain forms of jobs the internet has opened up all other forms of jobs education is far behind where it needs to be for us as human beings to be informed enough to not be disappointed in the way that so many people were we have to ask questions none of us are experts at everything when they go up and question the candidates and it s all about what the fuck they remember it s not about what you remember it s about do you have the ability to work with the best of class people be joking about donald he ain t even know that he had to get this he had to get that but does he have the ability to work with the best of class well it d be a prejudice because of something he would ve said earlier right when he was running to win but if he takes the model the same model i m gonna take in if he takes the model to work with the best in class and to work from a place of empathy for people for the family of people not just america the world we are one world bro we are one race bro there s a lot of people who said things that offended people benjamin carson is a fucking genius he might ve said things that offended people maybe bernie sanders ain t have the right look for something or maybe people was tired by the status quo of politics they just wanted to see could possibly something fucking change this fucking s education system this fucking class system this ecosystem maybe there was people out there who wanted to see that something could possibly fucking change in this political ass society that s not doing nothing to help each other out but only to keep themselves in fucking power people tell me i can t talk to y all in this way there s a power to the saint pablo tour all y all know it s the coldest tour and all the type of shit right drake so the funny thing about the guy throwing up the views hat is the reason why i might not have thrown on the views hat is to show the power of this tour nah i m the man i m ye this is my tour right but then when motherfucking pop style come on everybody go crazy it s from this album motherfuckers is always trying to do power plays that s what politics are but fuck all the power plays and all that type of shit collective ideas it s the collective idea of hillary or if we like bill clinton and things that he did for the country we like things about obama things that he did that our current president has to take the best of all candidates principles and combine them right now if that doesn t happen i mma run and i mma say this and it s gonna be more clear if that does happen there might not be a reason to y all might not totally understand the approach to why i m saying what i m saying you know they try to embarrass me and diminish me and say they call me a rapper that s ranting i don t have all of the answers but i know that if i work with the best of class with the idea of empathy for the human race that idea of a power struggle between who s republican who s democrat who said this who said that internet echochamber one thing that i do have the ability to do is talk as long the fuck as i want right here some people might have a less enjoyable pop experience than others but if you clap when i m in the middle of an idea it s just distracting this is my platform i did have a lot to say i did have a lot of things that i felt about the paradigm shift that we are under right now and i was told to not say certain ideas i had because oh your fans won t understand the reason why you re echoed to on the internet is because people believe that you won t understand i wanna ask a question again strictly this question not what you believe is right or wrong on who won strictly this question answer me this do you believe that there are people here enjoying before i started talking at least a kanye west show that voted for trump by a show of screams do you believe that there are people at a kanye west show that voted for trump it sounds different than before why did we boo the first time on something that wasn t hey do

sample clearance ltd all songs produced by kanye west for konman entertainment gimme my publishing co hip hop since roc a fella records llc you know one connection that i have you know to i believe everyone in this room but especially with like me and virgil and don c and fonzworth bentley and all the people from the infamous tommy ton then transferred to south park photo have dealt with in their life somehow you know being ridiculed for liking fashion for that being a career you want to take up like even with the stylist that i work with that s my i always call her my baby of m a s you re my m a s and i m your nicholas and her brother s a doctor and somehow in her family she s looked at like she didn t do as much in her life cause she did fashion and something you know and she was the little girl that eight years ago showed me who emmanuelle alt was back when i was you know less informed about how to put my shit together and i honest i mma jump to a point just so i don t take too long i believe that the world can be changed the world can be saved through design through unselfish design through unselfish creation you know god is the number one creator i m a christian i m not tryna push my opinions on anyone but in my opinion god is the number one creator and we anytime we you know create we re extension of doing his work on earth while we re here what can we do for humanity and you know in a way the fashion is what defines the time people could think in some way they re higher classes some higher statuses that contribute more to the world because you know they work on bombs they work at technology they you know they school teachers whatever it is that seems to be somehow that type of profession that when you say it everybody is oh you re a lawyer oh great lawyer motherfucker no knock to lawyers but you know what i m talking about so there are no movies without fashion we define the times we set in stone what did mean what did mean you know i always told anna i wanna be in the middle of that conversation as we all know the devil wears prada was about anna i said i wanna be in the middle of that conversation nah i m saying we know this so where she was talking about the blue sweater and previous to instagram and all that type of shit do you know this conversation you think you not part of fashion because you don t datatata like the blue sweater okay you would know this and somehow like me and my crew you know like all these straight black guys from chicago that no one knew why they were at the fucking show you know wanted to say let s make the conversation you know let s make the conversation shorter between you know when the blue sweater goes from a wang show to when it finally hit kohl s or something pre instagram pre all that shit pre people you know wanted to show what they had before images were the new currency when we talk about you know i was talking to rassi earlier and he was saying you know what his background was and you know the way he appreciated all of his opportunities that he has like to just being in america and being able to create and i told him he had to arm wrestle with virgil on like who is the greatest guy that i knew cause he s definitely one of the top you know one of these times when i look at like him and say wow you know i wish i could interact with people in the way that he interacts i wish that i could believe in people unselfishly without you know worrying about how it may affect me affects my reputation blabla or all of what fashion is because i think that s word fashion insiders but everyone s a fashion insider you know it s illegal to be naked everyone has some form of fashion every single day and i think it s the point i wanna make before i bring em up because i wanted to make this point to this room really you know we have the power to change the world i believe that through design cause design is the closest to truth problem solving truth is the closest to love love is the closest thing to god and god is love but we have to be unselfish in our approach which is the opposite of someone saying kanye you can t get in this show cause you re a celebrity or some shit like that you know the way we embrace celebrity the way what miley s had to go through in the past couple years dealing with the fashion bigots and shit like that i m not gonna give you guys the speech that tarantino gave at the lacma i mma say what the fuck he should ve really said you know the old guard accepting the new guard by letting down their guard i don t even know if i made one fucking good point but what i wanna say is this guy let me a celebrity designer work at milk studio when adidas couldn t figure out where my office was we didn t have windows you know it was cool you know we d go out and get a cup of coffee we stole a bunch of free cappuccinos from down the hallway and i promised him that i was gonna be fucking good it wasn t about me being a celebrity cause it could ve been like what do you mean you got a celebrity designer working at milk studio this is very authentic blablabla all the shit and he told me a story about this kid who stood on his steps and shit you know waiting for opportunities to design then went onto one day become the youngest american to run a french house called balenciaga that he believed in that kid back then believing in spending everything on alexander wang and i m closing now i don t move i don t leave my fucking crib unless i really believe in someone i don t read the teleprompters blablabla and i m so happy that jeremy is here cause jeremy asked me to come here also and jeremy is another one of those bad motherfuckers that changed the game and always expressed himself i m not gonna say shit else so all i mma say is i fucking love this guy and he sets an example to us as a humanitarian as a visionary and as an innovator rassi ellen how do you think marriage has changed you if it has kanye i've definitely learned how to compromise more which is something you have to understand when you partner with people in business you know you can't ellen beautiful kanye and i've learned how to shut up more and um i've yeah i think i think i'm a better human being you know because of her and because of my daughter and i have you know always someone to think about going home to and you know something for me to you know not only be brave for what i wanna do for humanity but also to be more protective of myself for my family too cause there's things i've done in the past that were considered negative but i was really you know jumping in front of the tank for other people or for culture in a way so now i always have to have that in my mind that i have like a family that i have to protect too ellen mm hmm yeah and i do see that change in you i see you and you are calmer i think you know you don't seem like uh like uh angry or you know you know what i mean and i don't know if it was even anger but it was just the way that you were getting all of your emotions out and now i think your emotions are grounded in a way that they come out in what you said and protection and love and and they're going they're channeled in a different way kanye i think i was like going through now like my version of my terrible twos my my daughter she wants to express herself but she just doesn't have the words for it and for me there's so many things i wanna do with film with clothing and i just didn't have the words or the resources or the backing or the perception that i could do it being that i was a rapper or you know all these things and now because of this adidas deal they allowed me a little bit of oxygen because what you have to understand the difference between you know what people give you about celebrity the idea of money versus creativity there's no amount of money that someone can give you to make you not be creative if you were born to create so a lot of times people try to block you block your creativity control you with money and adidas allowed me to make my whole clothing line which i wanted to do and it was just like a little bit of oxygen you guys last year two years ago three whatever you guys were seeing someone being suffocated by a perception being suffocated by people in a position that could blatantly see like wow the yeezys did really good he was this influential all those albums did this but we're not gonna give him a shot in something else and there's a lot of people who like were really calm about that but the definition of crazy is trying to do the same thing and expecting a different result so i tried something different over the past couple years and i actually got some really good results from it too so ellen well put well put and that is true i mean i think we all try to express ourselves and you do you keep doing the same thing and saying the same thing and saying the same thing it doesn't get the result you want until you try a different way of expressing yourself or whatever it is and then you get the result because you've shifted we have to take a break and then we're gonna show the world premiere of your new video which i absolutely love i love this song so much you actually played it for me in our living room and i just was blown away how beautiful the song is cut ellen so uh more kids kanye yeah we're trying ellen really kanye yeah yeah ellen i thought i'd slip that in there i mean that baby is so adorable and i mean she is precious she's so and smart as can be right kanye mm hmm ellen yeah she's oh look at that so you're gonna have more how many do you want like a bunch like a brad and angie bunch or uh kanye i just want whatever kim wants ellen wow um that's that's a good answer whether it's true or not and what is the name of the cd kanye i don't know yet we're still trying to find it trying to find the vibe you know this transition from what i felt when i did yeezus to what i feel now and you know we're just creating so we haven't found it yet ellen okay what about ellen's my friend kanye yeah i think that's pretty good ellen okay think about that in my soul gonna take you to the glory goal in my mind i can't study war yeah my i can't study war yeah my i can't study war yeah my i can't study war yeah my now where the south side i can't study no yeah my i can't study no yeah my now

obliged when i rhyme sometimes some things just pop out sometimes i must be a i forgot the medical name not a narcoleptic that be sleepin' how people was sleepin' when i made it deeper and i gotta be creepin' cause you know they didn't peep it uh they call me rockafella's best little secret uh i got the beats for the jeep when people used to rock amigo's and suzuki's and the isuzu's this the way you flow do flow aye yo you just like menudo played out about mad years ago and uh i could rock off the top i got years of flow i got so many albums to go at least about seven jesus walks had me all the way thought i was gon' rhyme that no you didn't time that yo that's where the line's at look at my shows look how long that the line's at all the way to the back sold out one night that's the way it is when you done it right take time to drop a album don't just be buyin' beats from everybody cause everybody ain't got it i got it i get it i only give it to those who really live it like jay z the game and my dogs that really did it like kweli like common like dudes that really spit it i'm talkin' 'bout they go onto the radio and hit it and as far as makin' your songs it's all wrong you be doin' everything that everybody else is on man i'mma break it down let me take it down here goes the instructions on how to not say nothin' look you take the crack concept and you do that 'til it's all dead and gone you do it all wrong now uh you take the car concept and i see it every video every single place i go same shit man you know the beat ran out on me i was gonna i was gonna i was gonna break down that was mean that was mean i was gonna break down to people exactly how to make the good song and the good album for a change let's go let's go let's go first of all what you need's a beat from me if you can't get a beat from me get a beat from your guy he'll prolly do it for free and if he do it like he'll prolly do it for e and if he do he'll prolly do it for skeet yo yo yo yo yo yo you gotta bring with your flow you gotta take it on beat and off beat and don't rap on no fuckin' soft beats you know that real hard shit regardless i played my part in this like this corner beat this what you want when you want a beat and that's when you really is gonna be a hip hop legend like kan like kan like of course the louis vuitton 'ton don don if i do say so myself and i do all the time every rhyme cause i'm i'm feelin' myself and if you was me you'd be feelin' yourself you see if you out in london you just hopped on a plane and you just came out of the bathroom you just got you some brain uh you doin' your thing and plus you flossin' that rocafella chain aye yo you know you let kan spit on 'em i'm rockin' the rocafella chain with no conflicts on 'em oh oh now let me bring it back to the flow flow and how you make the album and you make some dough dough get you a good manager cause your manager'll fuck your game up fuck your name up and uh if you've been runnin' to a trade your chain for some studio time see a lot of people be flossin' before they get a chance to a lot of people want club records they wanna dance to a lot of people want basslines they will enhance you bass in the club is good too what you should do is prolly get a single like alicia keys and if you don't know her holla at alicia please you know one of 'em light skin bitches with the braids actin' like they got it made you give a dawg with a fade you get somebody that's weak you get somebody that you know can't flow and you rap before him and let him go and people gon' be like well least you was better than dude and i don't mean to be rude and another thing you can do if you could channel the spirits like i channel i'm not talkin' 'bout lightin' candles i'm not talkin' sayonce i'm talkin' 'bout talkin' to god i mean just like once what i do before i rhyme every day is i pray i pray to god that he make these songs in a certain way i let him speak through me through the beats through the music i mean sometimes i go into the booth and lose it i mean i know he speakin' when i freak it in it a way that i coulda never thought of somethin' better to say so our father who art up above us i know any time we fuck you still love us like when i'm cursin' in my verses and i even do what's worse is when i'm spendin' too much spendin' on purses and shoes for my girl when i should be helpin'

high feels good to be home feels good to be home are y'all happy you came to vh storytellers get up and touch the sky come on i am so disappointed that i cannot see me perform except for on playback my greatest pain in live is that i'll never see me perform so you are welcome to know a pleasure that i will never have come on this song is what inspired 's and heartbreak more than anything because we used do this at the end of the tour every night and i would do it for how many of you saw the glow in the dark tour in the room tonight thank you so much for coming to the tour so y all remember at the end of the show i would do this song and i would say some inspirational words and i would sing and i had the opportunity to just kind of do it and play it off but i discovered that i love to sing so much and to my thing and harmonize and just go up and down and just fuck around i really feel like a vessel and i open my mouth and god will let beautiful words flow through that s why i realized that he chose me and he has a path for me because half the things that come out i can t be responsible for and i guess he just wants me to say more and more and more and never be insecure and always be sure be sure and he will give me the strength i need to endure for sure as i tour and bring the pure so much more more for sure for your entertainment education and relation to take away your hesitation and segregation in a country full of immigrants where no one really was born here but separated here it s a beautiful thing that in a country that was so divided by the concept of black and white we now have a black and white president and this is what the future is to me the juxtaposition two things that you think don t go together when a black super hip hop dressed dude gets on an elevator and there s an old lady with chanel and she grabs her purse i ll give you a clich example what would happen if they actually talk to each other what would she learn what would he learn when the rich man hopping out the lincoln town car passes by the homeless person and they actually talk to each other what would he learn what would he learn if a black man that came from chicago and was taught to stand so far away from gay people cause you do not want to be accused of being gay was to talk to a gay person what would he learn what did i learn i learned that people in chicago was wrong and i ve been an asshole all along a lot of things that you learn are wrong so don t be an asshole too long too long too long you can t be an asshole too long you can t be an asshole too long cause the more you know the more you grow the more responsibility you have show what you know and give everything that you got to give baby that s the reason god let me live through the accident without practicing okay got to bring this up and bring it back again okay okay okay okay alright no publishing outkast please alright shout out to three g s one of the few dressed quite as fresh as me fucked three white girls this evening martin luther king got it cause i overcome jimmy kimmel is out of line to try and spoof in any way the first piece of honest media in years jimmy kimmel i don't take it

fern mallis i just want you to understand that attempting to do clothing has been very difficult and i have encountered countless amounts of bigotry along the way i have millions of ideas and i represent a new generation just trying to express themselves in a broken world i don't call myself a designer as i was not allowed to go to saint martin's because i was too famous by the time i realized i wanted to design fame is often looked down upon in the design world so it's actually been something i had to overcome all we have are our dreams and you can step on our dreams and ideas all you want but we won't stop fighting we want to innovate and we will win someday if you wanna have a drink with me book a table at the spotted pig when i'm back in ny now media takeout always remember that you dissed the collection that changed the world you seem like the type of organization hired to always keep dreamers down when certain things in history happen you just got to respect it respect the struggle respect the hustle respect the dreams respect the movement i had an album listening and clothing presentation and madison square garden people were crying people were throwing up the fist people were dancing but media takeout couldn't say one thing positive knowing damn well you'd love to be on the yeezy list you probably got bootleg yeezy's on right now i'm a human being i'm an artist

on their shoulders and break through fashion fashion ain't no joke for me it's a way of life creative expression and industry i've given everything i had for this moment a lot of people feel it's the paradigm shift and i'm proud of this picture with me and caitlyn she gave the most heart felt speech at my wedding and was there in full support to see me realize this dream wow the paradigm has shifted she killed it everything is changed now lil sis kiiiiiiiilled this shit haaaaaaaaaaaaaa fuck all the haters put your miutherfucking fist in the sky right now i'm so hype right now everything

direct line of communication with our future president if we truly want change paul the most powerful messenger of the first century now we stand here centuries later because he was a traveler he was a learned man not of the original sect so he was able to take the message to the rest of the world he was saved from persecution due to his roman citizenship i have the right to speak my voice please forgive the profanity and give hugs and blessings to my brother kirk for standing by me in a few hours the journey begins all memes are wrong the life of paul the life of pablo ultralight beams moms

speak soon i would like to sit down with neil portnow right now i think the grammys are super important i know so many cool artists whose hearts have been broken by the politics including mine we need to fix this i don't give opinions because they are commonly agreed upon i say what i feel i feel the grammy awarding system is way off and completely out of touch hi grammys this is the most important living artist talking if i'm not at the show next year then there is no show i don't want to just fix the awards for me but i want to fix it for dexter navy who directed a ap rocky s lsd video everybody with any form of taste knows that was the best video of the year dexter didn't feel he even had a chance of winning and he was right you guys are supposed to be all about taste you like your black people a certain way also you wouldn't have future perform and that man owned the clubs last summer has anyone at the grammys ever heard march madness yes i have a problem with the grammys all artists have a problem with it and i am going to fix it for us all starting right now neil please reach out as soon as possible so we can make the grammys culturally relevant again us real music guys wanna have fun too and always remember that rock and roll was stolen and don't try to hide behind jimmy jam and terry lewis all positive vibes first order of business we the people need to see future at the grammys we need to see young thug at the grammys not just me and jay in a suit people ask why i speak in a public forum well my voice is my power freedom of speech freedom of opinion freedom of dreams i'm not crazy i'm free no slave mindset no more i'm free i'm free i'm free i wrote saint pablo after admitting to my greatest shame my personal debt but i'm not ashamed anymore i'm proud as an entrepreneur that i gave everything i had to my dreams i'm happy and free and proud and confident i'm not crazy i'm free free from being held back by public opinion it's a beautiful time i love my friends i love my family i love people the human race you guys will see my heart you guys will feel my heart we will make a difference i just had to start with shoes so that i could be economically empowered enough to have a voice what is your definition of true freedom there is no true freedom without economic freedom respect to everyone working hard to keep a roof over their kids that is one of the reasons i respect the paps so much and yes i've talked to adidas and we gon hook y'all up with free yeezys and adidas all positive vibes i'm not even gon lie to you i love me so much right now new album coming this summer i love being a voice of freedom when so many people are scared to speak up the world needs a guy like me the world needs somebody to not be scared and tell his truth you won't always agree with me but i'm gon always be me i'm woke i just feel rich people are always too cool to ask for help trying to impress each other at dinner parties i want to help the world and i need help to do it i am an artist and i care about humanity yes i am personally rich and i can buy furs and houses for my family but i need access to more money in order to bring more beautiful ideas to the world if i spent my money on my ideas i could not afford to take care of my family i am in a place that so many artist end up also for anyone that has money they know the first rule is to use other people's money i could not have done the msg without adidas but world what i'm telling you is that was just a small sketch for what i will bring you there are people who support artist and philanthropist and i think the idea of being a celebrity a lot of times blocks the understanding of what my purpose is i am of service to the world with my art and i just want to serve more i am ultra light beaming right now so many people have called or emailed to help today hedge fund guys billionaires etc i know i confuse you guys sometimes but please bare with me this is a god dream but if the self proclaimed cockiest person in the world can lay his personal business on the line then please people see my heart no matter what level you're at in life there is still a struggle and a balance art family perception friends family politics and the fucking manipulators people wanted me to tweet again well here's some tweets i did not diss taylor swift and i've never dissed her first thing is i m an artist and as an artist i will express how i feel with no censorship nd thing i asked my wife for her blessings and she was cool with it rd thing i called taylor and had a hour long convo with her about the line and she thought it was funny and gave her blessings th bitch is an endearing term in hip hop like the word nigga th thing i m not even gone take credit for the idea it s actually something taylor came up with she was having dinner with one of our friends who's name i will keep out of this and she told him i can't be mad at kanye because he made me famous facts th stop trying to demonize real artist stop trying to compromise real art that s why music is so fucking watered down right now i miss that dmx feeling i miss that feeling so that s what i want to help restore they want to control us with money and perception and mute the culture but you can see at madison square garden that you can stop us it felt like a seen from the warriors all gods all gods all gods in the buildin not just the famous people there but the kids the moms the dads the families that came to share this moment with us ten years ago today we finally released what had been my life's work up to that point the college dropout i say finally because it was a long road a constant struggle and a true labor of love to not only convince my peers and the public that i could be an artist but to actually get that art out for the world to hear i am extremely grateful to each and every person along that road who helped lent an ear lent their voice gave of their heart to that project and to all the projects that followed and are to come i am honored and humbled by my fans for the unwavering support and love over the past ten years i wake up every day trying to give something back to you that you can rock to and be proud of ten years later i am still the same kid from chicago still dreaming out loud still banging on the door the doors may be heavier but i promise you we will break them we

up in the sky and say we don't care what people say hey kanye this is your cousin kim i just wanted to call ya and congratulate you on this cd it's hot especially that song drug dealer you know i've been a social worker for years i've been paying people's lights rents mortgage you talkin' 'bout people paying shine on an hour people can't pay their rent for an hour so it just it's just really difficult to truly understand what these people are going through you know and people are human they wanna look good they wanna take pride at how they look they wanna take pride at what they do the other part that really hit home for me is that people borrow other people's kids and put it on their income tax a lot of times what they're doing with that money is finding another place to live because the place that they live in the toilet's overflowing or the roof is caving in and the landlord doesn't care landlord doesn't care enough to come in and fix those things and make sure that the people have a safe environment to live in so they borrow somebody else's kid so that maybe they can get a car so they can get back and forth to work cause you know in the hood the best paying job ain't always next to yo house it's not within walking distance 'til it get sky high so you have to take buses to get back and forth you have to spend a lot more money than what you have just on transportation then you get paid on the job so maybe they might buy a car maybe they might buy shoes for their kids you know and the drug dealing is just supplementary of all of that i mean like i said i don't condone it but i definitely got hugs for my thugs you know tryna' get out there makin' and the only thing that i can ask is once they stack the money 'til it get sky high is that they try to do something positive with it that they try to bring their kids to school that they try to make a difference next message my friend showed me pictures of his kids and all i could show him was pictures of my cribs he said his daughter got a brand new report card and all i got was a brand new sports car oh and my head keeps spinning can't stop having these visions i gotta get with it and my

word and try to dishumanize people who believe in themselves cuz then what happens then you believe in yourself and then you believe in yourself and you believe anything is possible how many people believe that what they dream about what y all want to do whether you want to be a doctor or lawyer a designer a musician video game programmer a lighting guy a manager how many people want to

face is supposed to mean fuck whatever kanye is supposed to mean it s about my dreams it s about everybody s dreams it s about creating it s not about the idea of being a fucking celebrity it s not about the idea of a black man trying to do fashion and shit cuz these walls that i break down these walls that i break down and we will and i m arguing with my friend spike jonze in the car cuz he said kanye what you need to say is you re gonna try you re gonna try to break them down don t say you re just going to do it and i said i am gonna do it i told kim seven years ago i m gonna marry you

antoinette trotman donna fetchko def jam recordings a division of umg recordings inc if you ever see somebody next to me know that they're better than me at something so bars bars so it's really good to have this event tonight which we decided instantaneously the way we put this shit together y'all comin' out here tonight vibin' with us in the way this whole albums put together the amount of producers that came together for it and the way we worked on this shit really collectively collaboratively we didn't give a fuck about what nobody else said outside lookin' in anything we just wanted to make the best product possible and this is just the beginning of an entirely new mentality of how to make music directed for the people what i said last night is like we drop this shit june th this ain't about waitin' until august and havin' some big this and that it's about deliverin' some shit for y'all to go to work to ride to listen to while y'all workin' out and shit whatever y'all doin' to provide a soundtrack for this shit that's gon' come out we gon' keep on doin' this shit over and over and over makin' shit for my core my cut with the creative director matt williams and virgil abloh the whole team don c ibn all the been trill family and the combination of all the people we brought together from daft punk workin' like joints on the album the first joint onsite i am a god bless me and mike dean travis scott workin' on the album hudson mohawke arca and of course at the end last wait a second am i forgettin' some people and shit last but not last that came and helped bring this whole shit together the executive producer of this lp and the family is rick rubin comin' in and finishing up the whole shit for us which is legendary because everything we did on this project everything i get like when we release 'numbers on the boards from the video to the no artwork to the sound of the song and everything i was like what would rick rubin do what was his def jam shit that they were doing because i remember like ricky would say when we did def jam we wasn't really feelin' like we was in competition with nobody cause this shit was so direct where we at right now we in the middle of the city right now over into the motherfuckin' streets and nobody shuttin' down shit while we makin' real music and yall vibin out to this shit so it's good for me to go to the god rick rubin and play him my shit ask him questions and allow him to take this project to an entirely new level and he made a lot of great decisions at the end and brought it to a whole new level and i wanted to explain something about the title yeezus simply put west was my slave name and yeezus is my god name tracklist click links for lyrics on sight black skinhead i am a god ft god new slaves
