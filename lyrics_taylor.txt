prologue these songs were once about my life they are now about yours i was born in reading pennsylvania on december in the world we live in much is said about when we are born and when we die our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world and a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it but lately i've been wondering what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death the moments when we are reborn the debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all i ever do is change all i ever do is learn from my mistakes so i don't make the same ones again then i make new ones i know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day every day i wake up as someone slightly new isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new for the last few years i've woken up every day not wanting but needing to write a new style of music i needed to change the way i told my stories and the way they sounded i listened to a lot of music from the decade in which i was born and i listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling i was also writing a different storyline than i'd ever told you before i wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world the city i had always been overwhelmed by until now i think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on new york and all its blaring truth i wrote about the thrill i got when i finally learned that love to some extent is just a game of cat and mouse i wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle there is no riding off into the sunset like i used to imagine we are never out of the woods because we are always going to be fighting for something i wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever and how some feelings never go out of style i wrote about an important lesson i learned recently that people can say whatever they want about me but they can't make me lose my mind i've learned how to shake things off i've told you my stories for years now some have been about coming of age some have been about coming undone this is a story about coming into your own and as a result coming alive i hope you know that you've given me the courage to change i hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be and that whispers behind your back don't define you you are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for from the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to new york or find happiness in a world where she is not in love love taylor welcome to new york

stage mostly i want to thank my co executive producer max martin who has deserved to be up here for years and as the first woman to win album of the year at the grammy's twice i want to say to all the young women out there there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame but if you just focus on the work and you don't let those people sidetrack you someday when you get where you're going you will know it was you and the people who love you who put you there and that will be the greatest feeling in the world thank you for this moment i wake up i stretch out i wonder what you're doin' right now yeah i slept in my makeup again tell myself 'i must be crazy' thinkin' 'bout him i find myself something decent to wear take the towel out of my hair about that time you call me and i'm reminded without you i'd be a stranger in an all night diner waiting for a love to find her lonely like a harbor light that's never seen a boat like a line in an old love letter no one ever wrote i go to work work all day i'm a walking tape recorder of everything you say walk to the car dig out my keys start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me i'm a stranger in an all night diner waiting for a love to find her lonely like a harbor light that's never seen a boat like a line in an old love letter no one ever wrote there you are on the street just standing there waiting on me i show you my new shoes you say you love them 'nd baby without you i'm a stranger in an all night diner waiting for a love to find her lonely like a harbor light that's never seen a boat like a line in an old love letter no one ever wrote i wake up i stretch out i wonder what you're doin' right now i walked through the door with you the air was cold but something 'bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sister's house and you've still got it in your drawer even now oh your sweet disposition and my wide eyed gaze we're singing in a car getting lost upstate the autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days and i know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more and i might be okay but i'm not fine at all 'cause there we are again on that little town street you almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin sized bed and your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team you taught me about your past thinking your future was me and i know it's long gone and there was nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to 'cause there we are again in the middle of the night we're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well yeah and maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'till you tore it all up running scared i was there i remember it all too well and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of being honest i'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here 'cause i remember it all all all too well time won't fly it's like i'm paralyzed by it i'd like to be my old self again but i'm still trying to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well yeah because there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known it was rare i was there i remember it all too well wind in my hair you were there you remember it all down the stairs you were there you remember it all it was rare i was there i remember it all too well people like you always want back the love they gave away and people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed the more i think about it now the less i know all i know is that you drove us off the road stay hey all you had to do was stay had me in the palm of your hand then why'd you have to go and lock me out when i let you in stay hey now

through the window i see her with you i m soaked to the skin you re warm and dry i guess the storm is over for you but look at the tears here in my eyes i just stood there like a ghost as you held her so close and as i let you go down came the rain lightning and thunder we tried in vain to hold on to each other winds of change blew you away from me love like this changes who you are every kiss you gave me is a scar just when our love was like a burning flame down came the rain all i need is to move on fast but all i want is to have you back and it just keeps falling down came the rain lightning

pasture at our home maybe one day they'll reach back in their file and pull out that old memory and think of me and smile and say it was just an old worn out jeep rusty old floor boards hot on my feet

called fearless and i guess i'd like to clarify why we chose that as the title to me fearless is not the absence of fear it's not being completely unafraid to me fearless is having fears fearless is having doubts lots of them to me fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death fearless is falling madly in love again even though you've been hurt before fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again even though every time you'e tried before you've lost it's fearless to have faith that someday things will change fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you even if you can't breathe without them i think it's fearless to fall for your best friend even though he's in love with someone else and when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they'll never stop doing i think it's fearless to stop believing them it's fearless to say you're not sorry and walk away i think loving someone despite what people think is fearless i think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless letting go is fearless then moving on and being alright that's fearless too but no matter what love throws at you you have to believe in it you have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after that's why i write these songs because i think love is fearless fearless hidden message i loved you before i met you fifteen hidden message i cried while recording this love story hidden message someday i'll find

very first day you say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while try and stay out of everybody's way it's your freshman year and you're going to be here for the next four years in this town hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say you know i haven't seen you around before because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're going to believe them and when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out well count to ten take it in this is life before you know who you're going to be fifteen you sit in class next to a redhead named abigail and soon enough you're best friends laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool we'll be outta here as soon as we can and then you're on your very first date and he's got a car and you're feeling like flying and your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one and you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends when the night ends because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're going to believe them when you're fifteen and your first kiss makes your head spin 'round but in your life you'll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team but i didn't know it at fifteen when all you wanted was to be wanted wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now back then i swore i was going to marry him someday but i realized some bigger dreams of mine and abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind and we both cried because when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you you're going to believe them and when you're fifteen don't forget to look before you fall i've found time can heal most anything and you just might find who you're supposed to be i didn't know who i was supposed to be at

my stairs six months gone and i'm still reaching even though i know you're not there i was playing back a thousand memories baby thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through maybe i've been going back too much lately when time stood still and i had you come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said you're sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now i know people change and these things happen but i remember how it was back then wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing cause nothing like this ever happened to them now i'm pacing down the hall chasing down your street flashback to the night when you said to me nothing's gonna change not for me and you not before i knew how much i had to lose come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said you're sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now if you're out there if you're somewhere if you're moving on i've been waiting for you ever since you've been gone i just want it back the way it was before and i just want to see you back at my front door and i say come back come back come back to me like you would before you said it's not that easy before the fight before i locked you out but i take it all back now come back come back come back to me like you would you would if this was a movie stand in the rain outside till i came out come back come back come back to me like you could you could if you just said you're sorry i know that we could work it out somehow but if this was a movie you'd be here by now you'd be here by now it's not the kind of ending you want to see now baby what about the ending oh i thought you'd be here by now thought you'd be here by now if you're anything like me you bite your nails and laugh when you're nervous you promise people the world because that's what they want from you you like giving them what they want but darling you need to stop if you're anything like me you knock on wood every time you make plans you cross your fingers hold your breath wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck rest in peace to your naive bravado if life gets too good now darling it scares you if you're anything like me you never wanted to lock your door your secret garden gate or your diary drawer didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore for fear she was much better before but darling now you have to if you're anything like me there's a justice system in your head for names you'll never speak again and you make your ruthless rulings each new enemy turns to steel they become the bars that confine you in your own little golden prison cell but darling there is where you meet yourself if you're anything like me you've grown to hate your pride to love your thighs and no amount of friends at will fill the empty seats at the lunch tables of your past the teams that picked you last but darling you keep trying if you're anything like me you couldn't recognize the face of your love until they stripped you of your shiny paint threw your victory flag away and you saw the ones who wanted you anyway darling later on you will thank your stars for that frightful day if you're anything like me i'm sorry but darling it's going to be okay wish i had concentrated they said love was complicated but it's something i just fell into and it was over rated but just look what i ve created i came out alive but i m black and blue ue before you ask me if i m alright think about what i had to do o yeah wake up and smell the break up fix my heart put on my make up another mess i didn't plan and i ll bet you thought you'd beat me wish you could only see i've got an i heart question mark written on the back of my hand i'd be fine if you just walked by but you had to talk about why you were wrong and i was right but i can't believe you made me sit at home and cry like a baby wait right by the phone every night and now you ask about you and i there's no you and i remember what you put me through i had to wake up and smell the break up fix my heart put on my make up another mess i didn't plan and i ll bet you thought you'd beat me wish you could only see i've got an i heart question mark written on the back of my hand and when you're home alone at night you'll still wonder why you took everything i had oh baby i had a lot about you and i there's no you and i and i know someday you will wake up and smell the break up realize that we won't make up it didn't go the way you planned and you'll know you didn't beat me when you look down and see i've got an i heart question mark written on the back of my hand written on the back of my hand an i heart question mark yeah written on the back of my hand once upon a time a few mistakes ago i was in your sights you got me alone you found me you found me you found me i guess you didn't care and i guess i liked that and when i fell hard you took a step back without me without me without me and he's long gone when he's next to me and i realize the blame is on me 'cause i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been till you put me down oh i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been now i'm lying on the cold hard ground oh oh trouble trouble trouble oh oh trouble trouble trouble no apologies he'll never see you cry pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why you're drowning you're drowning you're drowning and i heard you moved on from whispers on the street a new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be and now i see now i see now i see he was long gone when he met me and i realize the joke is on me hey i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been till you put me down oh i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been now i'm lying on the cold hard ground oh oh trouble trouble trouble oh oh trouble trouble trouble and the saddest fear comes creeping in that you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been till you put me down oh i knew you were trouble when you walked in so shame on me now flew me to places i'd never been now i'm lying on the cold hard ground oh oh trouble trouble trouble oh oh trouble trouble trouble i think i think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes you know it's like a kaleidoscope of memories it just all comes back but he never does i think part of me knew the second i saw him that this would happen it's not really anything he said or anything he did it was the feeling that came along with it and the crazy thing is i don't know if i'm ever gonna feel that way again but i don't know if i should i knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright but i just thought how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you maybe he knew that when he saw me i guess i just lost my balance i think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him it was losing me you stand with your hand on my waistline it's a scene and we're out here in plain sight i can hear them whisper as we pass by it's a bad sign bad sign something happens when everybody finds out see the vultures circling dark clouds love's a fragile little flame it could burn out it could burn out 'cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run baby i know places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down 'cause i i know places we can hide i know places i know places lights flash and we'll run for the fences let them say what they want we won't hear it loose lips sink ships all the damn time not this time just grab my hand and don't ever drop it my love they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run baby i know places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down 'cause i i know places we can hide i know places i know places they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run just grab my hand and don't ever drop it my love baby i know places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down 'cause i i know places we can hide i know places i know places they take their shots we're bulletproof i know places and you know for me it's always you i know places in the dead of night your eyes so green i know places and i know for you it's always me i know places so over the years a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end how long does it take where do you write what are the circumstances do you start with music do you start with lyrics and my answer is always that it happens differently every time and that's why i'm still so in love with song writing so what i've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started different ways so i'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how i put songs together i sent this voice memo to ryan tedder because i'd always wanted to work with him and finally we scheduled some studio time so i always wanna be prepared i wanted to send him the idea that i was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said i can't stand that i wanna work on something else think of something else so i just sat down with the piano put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where i wanted to go with the song how i saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called i know places so this was the voice memo i sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing uh uh uh oh oh oh oh i oh oh oh oh oh oh i oh oh oh oh oh oh oh i i i na na na na waiting at the back door they're around and the vultures come around and you know that they won't they won't us say what they want 'bout say what they want 'bout us and you come and sing and listen i would not think about it but i'm not done every know that a thing or two about it thing or two about it i cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns they are the hunters we are the foxes and we run baby i know places we won't be found and they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down cause i i know places we can hide i know places i know places uh uh uh i uh uh uh i oh oh i uh uh uh i no places or whatever i don't know but that's basically just like a dark really dark lyric like bridge thing and it's about like everyone is trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever and it's like you just whatever you know and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus so i hope you like it it wouldn't be a piano thing i like my music loud i like my windows down so i can scream i like my trucks a little bigger than the rest so i can see don t try me don t fight me you be you and i ll be me they say i ve always known what i wanted my friends and enemies will tell you it s true you will find out i always get it i know what i want and it ain t you your mom and daddy s walls are covered up in pictures of you you never met a mirror that you didn't look again into

leaving well i guess i wished on a plane i thought was a star i guess what you wrote on a paper wasn't really from your heart could've sworn you said you loved me i guess heard you wrong and i guess i wished on a plane and i thought was a star diving off into the deep end honestly believe you'd be there when i jumped in is aren t your territory we had the perfect love story except ending nothing comes true when it comes to you and i was too cloudy it's not my fault i just couldn't see throwing pennies at the fountain when you're standing on a mountain it's kind of hard to aim it's am in your car windows down you pass my street the memories start you say it's in the past you drive straight ahead you're thinking that i hate you now cause you still don't know what i never said i wish you would come back wish i never hung up the phone like i did and i wish you knew that i'd never forget you as long as i live and i wish you were right here right now it's all good i wish you would it's am in my room headlights pass the window pane i think of you we're a crooked love in a straight line down makes you want to run and hide then it makes you turn right back around i wish you would come back wish i never hung up the phone like i did and i wish you knew that i'd never forget you as long as i live and i wish you were right here right now it's all good i wish you would i wish we could go back and remember what we were fighting for and i wish you knew that i miss you too much to be mad anymore and i wish you were right here right now it's all good i wish you would i i i i i i i wish

we're a crooked love in a straight line down makes you wanna run and hide but it made us turn right back around i wish you would come back wish i never hung up the phone like i did i wish you knew

you would i wish you would i wish you would i wish you would i wish you would this is another way i've written songs recently this is a song i did with jack antonoff and jack is one of my friends and so we're hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes i made this amazing track the other day it's so cool i love these guitar sounds and he played it for me and immediately i could hear this finished song in my head and i just said please please let me have that let me play with is send it to me and so he sent it to me and i was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called i wish you would because jack wrote back and said i love that so this is another way of writing it's writing to track okay so this is an idea called i wish you would it's kind of about this guy who's like he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex girlfriend's house and it's like he thinks she hate him but she's still in love with him very dramatic this track is sick hope you like this it's am in your car windows down past my street the memories start it's in the past you drive straight ahead you thinking that i hate you now cause you still don't know what i never said i wish you would come back wish i never hung up the phone like i did i wish you knew that do you like it i

christmas i wrapped it up and sent it with a note saying 'i love you' i meant it now i know what a fool i've been but if you kiss me now i know you would fool me again last christmas i gave you my heart but the very next day you gave it away this year to save me from tears i will give it to someone special last christmas i gave you my heart but the very next day you gave it away this year to save me from tears i will give it to someone special a crowded room and friends with tired eyes i am hiding from you and your soul of ice my god i thought you were someone to rely on me i guess i was a shoulder to cry on a face on a lover with a fire in his heart a girl on a cover but you tore her apart maybe this year maybe this year i will give it to someone special because last christmas i gave you my heart but the very next day you gave it away this year to save me from tears i will give it to someone special last christmas i gave you my heart but the very next day you gave it away this year to save me from tears i will give it to someone special and last christmas and this year it won't be anything like anything like last christmas i gave you my heart but the very next day you gave it away this year to save me from tears i will give it to someone special i still remember the look on your face lit through the darkness at the words that you whispered for just us to know you told me you loved me so why did you go away away i do recall now the smell of the rain fresh on the pavement i ran off the plane that july th the beat of your heart it jumps through your shirt i can still feel your arms but now i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips i do remember the swing of your step the life of the party you're showing off again and i roll my eyes and then you pull me in i'm not much for dancing but for you i did because i love your handshake meeting my father i love how you walk with your hands in your pockets how you kissed me when i was in the middle of saying something there's not a day i don't miss those rude interruptions but now i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips so i'll watch your life in pictures like i used to watch you sleep and i feel you forget me like i used to feel you breathe and i keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are hope it's nice where you are and i hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day and something reminds you you wish you had stayed you can plan for a change in weather and time but i never planned on you changing your mind so i'll go sit on the floor wearing your clothes all that i know is i don't know how to be something you miss i never thought we'd have a last kiss never imagined we'd end like this your name forever the name on my lips just like our last kiss forever the name on my lips forever the name on my lips just like our last one daybreak one heartache every once upon a time that black dress happiness bubble baths and quarter lines they mean so much to everyone but you count them up one by one clear midnights and this spotlight once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall a blue bonnet a braid on it quiet winters and leaves that always fall your black boots my red flower ring live for the little things oil paintings and making every detail turn out bad one last stands new romance living for that love and person ohh yeah ohh no fighting black riding wish upon a star and give the moon a smile pretending defending take a risk and go along for the ride strawberries and fairies with wings live for the little things na na na oh yeah na na na ohh yeah na na na i said remember this moment in the back of my mind the time we stood with our shaking hands the crowds in the stands went wild we were the kings and the queens and they read off our names the night you danced like you knew our lives would never be the same you held your head like a hero on a history book page it was the end of a decade but the start of an age long live the walls we crashed through all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered i said remember this feeling i passed the pictures around of all the years that we stood there on the side lines wishing for right now we are the kings and the queens you traded your baseball cap for a crown when they gave us our trophies and we held them up for our town and the cynics were outraged screaming this is absurd cause for a moment a band of thieves in ripped up jeans got to rule the world long live the walls we crashed through all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders i'm not afraid long live all the mountains we moved i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you i was screaming long live that look on your face and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered hold on to spinning around confetti falls to the ground may these memories break our fall will you take a moment promise me this that you'll stand by me forever but if god forbid fate should step in and force us into a goodbye if you have children some day when they point to the pictures please tell them my name tell them how the crowds went wild tell them how i hope they shine long live the walls we crashed through i had the time of my life with you long long live the walls we crashed through all the kingdom lights shined just for me and you i was screaming long live all the magic we made and bring on all the pretenders i'm not afraid singing long live all the mountains we moved i had the time of my life fighting dragons with you and long long live that look on your face and bring on all the pretenders one day we will be remembered lembrei desse sentimento gritando

one moment would you capture it or just let it slip yo his palms are sweaty knees weak arms are heavy there's vomit on his sweater already mom's spaghetti he's nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs but he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down the whole crowd goes so loud he opens his mouth but the words won't come out he's choking how everybody's joking now the clock's run out time's up over blaow you better lose yourself in the music the moment you own it you better never let it go you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo you better lose yourself in the music the moment you own it you better never let it go you only get one shot do not miss your chance to blow this opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo you make me smile like the sun fall outta bed sing like a bird dizzy in my head spin like a record crazy on a sunday night you make me dance like a fool forget how to breathe shine like gold buzz like a bee just the thought of you can drive me wild oh you make me smile we were both young when i first saw you i close my eyes and the flashback starts i'm standing there on a balcony in summer air see the lights see the party the ball gowns see you make your way through the crowd and say hello little did i know that you were romeo you were throwing pebbles and my daddy said stay away from juliet and i was crying on the staircase begging you please don't go and i said romeo take me somewhere we can be alone i'll be waiting all there's left to do is run you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess it's a love story baby just say yes so i sneak out to the garden to see you we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew so close your eyes escape this town for a little while 'cause you were romeo i was a scarlet letter and my daddy said stay away from juliet but you were everything to me i was begging you please don't go and i said romeo take me somewhere we can be alone i'll be waiting all there's left to do is run you'll be the prince and i'll be the princess it's a love story baby just say yes romeo save me they're trying to tell me how to feel this love is difficult but it's real don't be afraid we'll make it out of this mess it's a love story baby just say yes oh oh i got tired of waiting wondering if you were ever coming around my faith in you was fading when i met you on the outskirts of town and i said romeo save me i've been feeling so alone i keep waiting for you but you never come is this in my head i don't know what to think he knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said marry me juliet you'll never have to be alone i love you and that's all i really know i talked to your dad go pick out a white dress it's a love story baby just say 'yes' oh oh oh oh because we were both young when i first saw you i want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles maybe i'm wrong but i don't think romeo would be my kind of guy i want a love that's sweeter than roses and for me this is how it's gonna be like there's a fairytale guy and he whispers sweet lullabies and the music plays from nowhere as we dance in the pale moonlight with candles and fireflies all night everybody thinks about love i want love they haven't thought of yet here on the couch with a box of chocolates that i bought myself i'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help it's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied i don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect like there's a fairytale guy and he whispers sweet lullabies and he music plays from nowhere as we dance in the pale moonlight with candles and fireflies all night everybody thinks about love i want love they haven't thought of yet i want my own little storybook ending we'll make it up as we go there's a fairytale guy and he whispers sweet lullabies and the music plays from nowhere as we dance in the pale moonlight with candles and fireflies all night everybody thinks about love i want love they haven't thought of yet i want love they haven't thought of yet come on gather 'round i'm gonna tell you how the fire went out sorry for the inconvenience i didn't mean to let you down we were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me you were the perfect view of misery i never talked about the tears i cried all the sleepless nights or the endless fights i never talked about the days he called there was something wrong it was all my fault i had it all what a shame what a fall now but in case you haven't heard the news there wasn't much love to lose let's talk about that golden boy that i met on a winter night how was i supposed to know that he was just as cold inside he smiled and i smiled well the camera's in your mind and i lied i swore that everything was fine i never talked about the tears i cried all the sleepless nights or the endless fights i never talked about the nights he called there was something wrong it was all my fault i had it all what a shame what a fall now but in case you haven't heard the news there wasn't much love to lose i know you wanna talk about me how i gave up on love so foolishly but keep in mind i never talked about the tears i cried all the sleepless nights or the endless fights i never talked about the nights he called there was something wrong it was all my fault i had it all what a shame what a fall now but in case you haven't heard the news there wasn't much love to lose come on gather 'round i'm gonna tell you how the fire went out there's a little girl in this little town with a little too much heart to go around live forever never say never you could do better that's what she says mama named her lucky on a starlit night a rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite of the fact that she's different and yet she's the same and she says lucky you lucky you she sings her little song she walks along a little pathway headed for the skies left to travels lives they unravel mind over matter that's what she says mama named her lucky on a starlit night a rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite of the fact that she's different and yet she's the same and she says lucky you lucky you lucky you maybe she'll sing you do do do do maybe she'll bring you into the skies honey she'll love you funny how some view angels above you aren t so far away mama named her lucky on a starlit night a rabbit foot in her pocket she dances in spite of the fact that she's different and yet she's the same and she says lucky you lucky you your feet under the table i love it when they're touching mine your hands make the crisps at the cradle to tell me everything is fine all i see is you looking at me do you know when you go you make the sweetest sight at the window if you had never come out of the blue i would have stayed up and made up you you smile just like a picture it doesn't even need a frame sometimes i wait to answer just to hear you say my name and all i want is just what i've got i'd never let you go even if i could cause i never could've dreamed you up this good oh oh made up you oh oh made up you i need you more than i know how to mention and i'd give forever to get your attention be you're summer midnight with starry blue eyes that only see you and are yours every night ooh ooh love's like this it's something i missed ooh ooh love's like this and that small town daydream lasted all night 'cause tonight all those bright city lights just look at you look at me heaven looked down to see we're falling now and there's nothing we ain't too sure of just two kids making up for lost love all of the days that i couldn't get it right it all disappeared lying here by your side with your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile you make it look easy changing my life heaven had quite the time to figure this life out but baby i've got mine to give you everything you dream about he's got a nice little life he's gonna live it but on friday nights he plays

were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you and i could have spent a life with you but those days are over you were calling my name when your face faded from view wasn't it you that told me the sun would always chase the day wasn't it you that told me angels fly in the air tonight saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake stars collide in the air so light or was it just like those promises that you made on our last night oh i remember waking up with you the days doing nothing you meant more to me then than you ever knew you were going to be a doctor a movie star poet at a nobel seminar hope the the world never tore that out of you tell me whatever happened to the things you loved and the songs we played and the indian days whatever happened to the things you gave away like harold and martin singing i was waving as you drove away the sunlight was falling you were riding backwards in a dusty window pane angels fly in the air tonight was it just like the promises that we made and stars collide in the air so light was it just like those promises that you made on our last night on our last night oh oh oh whoa whoa yeah oh elevator buttons and morning air strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs if you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares but right now my time is theirs seems like there's always someone who disapproves they'll judge it like they know about me and you and the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do the jury's out but my choice is you so don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard the stakes are high the water's rough but this love is ours you never know what people have up their sleeves ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles but i don't care 'cause right now you're mine and you'll say don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard the stakes are high the water's rough but this love is ours and it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and your hands are tough but they are where mine belong and i'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you 'cause i love the gap between your teeth and i love the riddles that you speak and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored 'cause my heart is yours so don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine and life makes love look hard don't you worry your pretty little mind people throw rocks at things that shine but they can't take what's ours they can't take what's ours the stakes are high the water's rough but this love is ours i was riding shotgun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car he's got a one hand feel on the steering wheel the other on my heart i look around turn the radio down he says baby is something wrong i say nothing i was just thinking how we don't have a song and he says our song is the slamming screen door sneakin' out late tapping on your window when we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'cause it's late and your mama don't know our song is the way you laugh the first date man i didn't kiss her and i should have and when i got home 'fore i said amen asking god if he could play it again i was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day

screen door sneakin' out late tapping on your window when we're on the phone and you talk real slow 'cause it's late and your mama don't know our song is the way you laugh the first date man i didn't

and bobby think that they're a perfect pair but girls could say he's just a bit too tall you don't have to do to win big you just have to think it some folks say the glass is half full others choose to drink it some say the grass could be greener and the other side ain't far away but i say the old could be newer and love still counts when it doesn't stay some say i love you some say love needs proof it's all in your point of view he hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes his nfl was turned to tlc baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know but they all do and wish that

still counts when it doesn't stay some say i love you some say love needs proof it's all in your point of view it's all in your point of view point of view it's all in your point of view i'm curled up in my mother's bed staring intently at my laptop i'm watching a video of a familiar looking man wearing a black tuxedo the video seems to be of a televised award show the tape is grainy but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear now i'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand her voice is full like solid gold with some platinum blended in sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes but gold is brenda's metal in this song i wish i'd wrote ladies and gentlemen brenda lee the camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties the music starts and she's looking down at a framed picture she's at ease she is theatrical and she is beautiful in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye lights camera action she starts to sing that's when you hear the gold and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand the performance ends and the crowd goes wild the lovely lady graciously takes a bow she smiles out into the vast darkness taking it all in with grace and composure the video ends and i reflect back on what i just saw it was a timeless performance but here are the facts the year is the song is someone loves you honey the man in the tuxedo is johnny cash and the woman in the beautiful dress with the honey like voice is none other than brenda lee brenda lee who was born in near atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father brenda lee the little girl who took over the music world with chart topping hits when she was still a child brenda lee the woman who ushered in a new style of rock roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television brenda lee the artist who later went back to her country roots proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under brenda lee the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her i watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause there's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years brenda lee is grace brenda lee is class and composure and when she hears the roar of a crowd brenda lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation brenda lee is someone i will always look up to because of the way she shines as johnny cash said in it's almost like she's golden knew he was a killer first time that i saw him wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted but if he's a ghost then i can be a phantom holdin' him for ransom some some boys are tryin' too hard he don't try at all though younger than my exes but he act like such a man so i see nothing better i keep him forever like a vendetta ta i i i see how this is gon' go touch me and you'll never be alone i island breeze and lights down low no one has to know in the middle of the night

loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all losing him was blue like i'd never known missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong losing him was blue like i'd never known missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes tell myself it's time now gotta let go but moving on from him is impossible when i still see it all in my head in burning red loving him was red losing him was blue like i'd never known missing him was dark grey all alone forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met but loving him was red and that's why he's spinning 'round in my head comes back to me burning red yeah yeah his love was like driving a new maserati down a dead end street tracklist state of grace red treacherous i knew you were trouble all too well i almost do we are never ever getting back together stay stay stay the last time holy ground sad beautiful tragic the lucky one everything has changed starlight begin again target bonus tracks the moment i knew come back be here girl at home demo version of treacherous demo version of red acoustic version of state of grace album art standard edition deluxe edition foreword there's an old poem by neruda that i've always been captivated by and one of the lines in it has stuck with me ever since the first time i read it it says love is so short forgetting is so long it's a line i've related to in my saddest moments when i needed to know someone else had felt that exact same way and when we're trying to move on the moments we always go back to aren't the mundane ones they are the moments you saw sparks that weren't really there felt stars aligning without having any proof saw your future before it happened and then saw it slip away without any warning these are moments of newfound hope extreme joy intense passion wishful thinking and in some cases the unthinkable letdown and in my mind every one of these memories looks the same to me i see all of these moments in bright burning red my experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons especially my experiences with crazy love the red relationships the ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded and it was awful and ridiculous and desperate and thrilling and when the dust settled it was something i d never take back because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly you jump in head first without looking and there's something to be learned from waiting all day for a train that's never coming and there's something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight and doesn't fade or spontaneously combust maybe i ll write a whole album about that kind of love if i ever find it but this album is about the other kinds of love that i ve recently fallen in and out of love that was treacherous sad beautiful and tragic but most of all this record is about love that was red state of grace

too well love story treacherous we are never ever getting back together here's something i've learned about people we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us we know our friend in a certain light but we don't know them the way their lover does just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend their mother knows them differently than their roommate who knows them differently than their colleague their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness and yet a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd nothing more we may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true we may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip this is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet and together we will all discover the after effects of that ultimately we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us but then we wake up look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes and cringe we hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future their partner their forever someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you the point being despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify we are never just good or just bad we are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party existing somewhere between our well lit profile photo and our drivers license shot we are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity loyalty and self preservation pragmatism and impulsiveness i've been in the public eye since i was years old on the beautiful lovely side of that i've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving vibrant people on the other side of the coin my mistakes have been used against me my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing' when this album comes out gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test there will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory because it's and if you didn't see a picture of it it couldn't have happened right let me say it again louder for those in the back we think we know someone but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us there will be no further explanation there will be just reputation i could have keyed your car i could have rolled your yard i know the passwords to your emails and everything you do i could have put them to good use but i'm dressed to kill and tonight i am going out on a date with your best friend he always liked me anyway r e v

'cause i see sparks fly whenever you smile and the sparks fly oh baby smile and the sparks fly i am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl i sneak in and see your friends and her snotty little family all dressed in pastel and she is yelling at a bridesmaid somewhere back inside a room wearing a gown shaped like a pastry this is surely not what you thought it would be i lose myself in a daydream where i stand and say don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now fond gestures are exchanged and the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march and i am hiding in the curtains it seems that i was uninvited by your lovely bride to be she floats down the aisle like a pageant queen but i know you wish it was me you wish it was me don't you don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now ooh la da da da oh ooh ooh say a single vow i hear the preacher say speak now or forever hold your peace there's the silence there's my last chance i stand up with shaking hands all eyes on me horrified looks from everyone in the room but i'm only looking at you i am not the kind of girl who should be rudely barging in on a white veil occasion but you are not the kind of boy who should be marrying the wrong girl hehe don't say yes run away now i'll meet you when you're out of the church at the back door don't wait or say a single vow you need to hear me out and they said speak now and you say let's run away now i'll meet you when i'm out of my tux at the back door baby i didn't say my vows so glad you were around when they said speak now prologue 'speak now or forever hold your peace ' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world right before the vows it's a last chance for protest a moment that makes everyone's heart race and a moment i've always been strangely fascinated by so many fantasize about bursting into a church saying what they'd kept inside for years like in the movies in real life it rarely happens real life is a funny thing you know in real life saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial so crucial in fact the most of us start to hesitate for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time but lately what i've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything i think most of us fear reaching the end of our life and looking back regretting the moments we didn't speak up when we didn't say 'i love you ' when we should've said 'i'm sorry ' when we didn't stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help these songs are made up of words i didn t say when the moment was right in front of me these songs are open letters each is written with a specific person in mind telling them what i meant to tell them in person to the beautiful boy whose heart i broke in december to my first love who i never thought would be my first heartbreak to my band to a mean man i used to be afraid of to someone who made my world very dark for a while to a girl who stole something of mine to someone i forgive for what he said in front of the whole world words can break someone into a million pieces but they can also put them back together i hope you use yours for good because the only words you ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone what you say might be too much for some people maybe it will come out all wrong and you ll stutter and you ll walk away embarrassed wincing as you play it all back in your head but i think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest so say it to them or say it to yourself in the mirror say it in a letter you ll never send or in a book millions might read someday i think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying i could ve but it s too late now there is a time for silence there is a time waiting your turn but if you know how you feel and you so clearly know what you need to say you ll know it i don't think you should wait i think you should speak now love

back of the room i'm spinning around i'm spinning around and all i see is someone i don't know love's got me tangled tired me too no sign of a wall sign of wall spinning me around and baby all i see

you don't get to control someone s emotional response to being called that bitch in front of the entire world of course i wanted to like the song i wanted to believe kanye when he told me that i would love the song i wanted us to have a friendly relationship he promised to play the song for me but he never did while i wanted to be supportive of kanye on the phone call you cannot approve a song you haven t heard being falsely painted as a liar when i was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination i would very much like to be excluded from this narrative one that i have never asked to be a part of since dj hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song and um up next in the countdown is taylor swift and have you heard this song yet tim mcgraw i have heard this song dj tim mcgraw and what what did you think the first time you heard it or how was the first time tim it was awesome uh except for i didn't know if i should i should take it as a compliment or i should feel old dj a ha ha ha tim i didn't know which one but the more the more i hear it the more i don't know if its true or not but i start taking it as a compliment and not that i feel that i'm old i don't know if that's true but that's what i choose to think dj why don't we find out taylor is a compliment or uh he's old taylor oh its definitely a compliment yeah laughing dj tim mcgraw meet taylor swift tim nice taylor nice to meet you tim nice to meet you taylor how you doing taylor i'm doing great how are you doing tim i'm doing good congratulations on your record it's doing great taylor thank you so much i'm just so excited thank you for uh having good music and everything i swear i'm not a stalker laughing dj well taylor the funny thing about this song is ya know as a writer some of the songs that you write like hours you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but i wrote this one in literally minutes and ya know i really didn't think anything about calling in tim mcgraw so i kinda shelved it for like months and never even thought that it was going to be a single but um my label heard it and was like we're putting that out laughing tim well i'm glad ya did cuz um it's doing well for ya dj so i so i understand that you two guys have not talked tim no dj you haven't met tim no taylor no we've never talked or met or anything tim i sent her a message one time i think with entertainment weekly or something like that oh i don't remember what show it was i was doing an interview and they were going to interview taylor the next day so i sent her a little message so i don't know if she got it or not taylor oh my god they never gave that to me tim they didn't ok well there ya go i did laughing dj so i i taylor we've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything tim not at all dj so i thought i think it's pretty brave to put out a song called tim mcgraw without maybe talking to tim mcgraw did you mind taylor it was definitely kind of a chance ya know i did say anything bad in the song so i was kinda thinking ya know he wouldn't take it too bad tim well thank you for that thank you for not saying anything bad i'm sure there's plenty that could've been said tell me taylor could you tell faith that i said hello tim i sure will i sure will and she loves the song too by the way taylor oh my gosh she's awesome tim i agree dj this this tell me about writing a song um did this did this really happen taylor well yeah i mean i never really kinda went into this writing session on i'm gonna write a song called tim mcgraw um yeah because that would just be weird but um laughing taylor i actually this this is kinda strange but i actually came up with the melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year of high school tim now i feel old taylor and um i was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself and i was going through a period where i was dating this guy that was going off to college and i knew we were gonna break up so i started to think about all the things that i knew would remind him of me and its kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know that my favorite songs are tim mcgraw songs they just are tim aww thank you taylor and uh you know so i kinda just thought about that first and so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano and wrote it with this co writer who was kinda wondering if i was crazy or not but it turned out alright and ya know the funny thing is that i shelved this song for like months and never never even played it for anybody never even demoed it and uh then one time i was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes well thats your first single laughing taylor and i'm like well tim well you can write songs about me anytime taylor laughing taylor thats awesome there's a part two coming out next month tim alright great laughing tim well congratulations cuz its your first single first top ten hit and thats pretty exciting and i know you're off to the races here you're just doing great and uh congratulations

look now the sky is gold i hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home i don't know why all the trees change in the fall but i know you're not scared of anything at all don't know if snow white's house is near or far away but i know i had the best day with you today i'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean i come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys and we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away and we talk and window shop 'til i've forgotten all their names i don't know who i'm going to talk to now at school but i know i'm laughing on the car ride home with you don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay but i know i had the best day with you today i have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger god smiles on my little brother inside and out he's better than i am i grew up in a pretty house and i had space to run and i had the best days with you there is a video i found from back when i was three you set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me it's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs and daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world and now i know why all the trees change in the fall i know you were on my side even when i was wrong and i love you for giving me your eyes for staying back and watching me shine and i didn't know if you knew so i'm taking this chance to say that i had the best day with you today i m a laid back t shirt blue jean mood ring kind of girl hey yeah what s the word on you lay low i m a mission rebel angel devil little lamb upper mental sometimes i get temper mental but here i am an open book turn the page it s all the rage get a look on the inside oh what you get is what you see baby you hold the key to the diary of me i m poetry complicated simply stated hey yeah baby how about you i was born free i m a cell phone hippie are you with me when i mess up i don t get up i just get down yeah it s raining on sunday there s nothing on tv yesterday was lonely you re the only one who gets me my mind is like an island drifting through the ocean i can t stop thinking about you i bet you re thinking of me too well here i am an open book turn the page it s all the rage get a look on the inside oh what you get is what you see baby you hold the key to the diary of me yeah here i am an open book turn the page it s all the rage get a look on the inside oh what you get is what you see baby you hold the key to the diary of me where will the music industry be in years years years before i tell you my thoughts on the matter you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying it's just coming alive there are many many people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity i am not one of them in my opinion the value of an album is and will continue to be based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work and the financial value that artists and their labels place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace piracy file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically and every artist has handled this blow differently in recent years you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away for this promotion or that exclusive deal my hope for the future not just in the music industry but in every young girl i meet is that they all realize their worth and ask for it music is art and art is important and rare important rare things are valuable valuable things should be paid for it's my opinion that music should not be free and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is i hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art arrows through the heartin mentioning album sales i'd like to point out that people are still buying albums but now they're buying just a few of them they are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone it isn't as easy today as it was years ago to have a multiplatinum selling album and as artists that should challenge and motivate us there are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever the way i see it fans view music the way they view their relationships some music is just for fun a passing fling the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit that they will soon forget they ever danced to some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past however some artists will be like finding the one we will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren as an artist this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans i think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond the one my father has with the beach boys and the one my mother has with carly simon i think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise no i did not say shock i said surprise i believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans in the youtube generation we live in i walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online to continue to show them something they had never seen before i brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me my generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient we want to be caught off guard delighted left in awe i hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes as challenging as that might be there are a few things i have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years the first being autographs i haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iphone with a front facing camera the only memento kids these days want is a selfie it's part of the new currency which seems to be how many followers you have on instagram fan powera friend of mine who is an actress told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses the casting director chose the actress with more twitter followers i see this becoming a trend in the music industry for me this dates back to when i walked into my first record label meetings explaining to them that i had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called myspace in the future artists will get record deals because they have fans not the other way around another theme i see fading into the gray is genre distinction these days nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence the wild unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes pop sounds like hip hop country sounds like rock rock sounds like soul and folk sounds like country and to me that's incredible progress i want to make music that reflects all of my influences and i think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career defining path and more of an organizational tool this moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless in this moment in music stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded and sonic evolution is not only accepted it is celebrated the only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all celebrity spotlighti predict that some things will never change there will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians especially the younger ones artists who were at their commercial peak in the ' s ' s and ' s tell me it was never this crazy for us back then and i suspect i'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday god help them there continues to be a bad girl vs good girl clean cut vs sexy debate and for as long as those labels exist i just hope there will be contenders on both sides everyone needs someone to relate to and as for me i'll just be sitting back and growing old watching all of this happen or not happen all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism and i'd also like a nice garden find myself at your door just like all those times before i m not sure how i got there all roads they lead me here i imagine you are home in your room all alone and you open your eyes into mine and everything feels better and right before your eyes i'm breaking no fuss no reasons why just you and me e he e he e he e he e he e he e he e

should've burst through the door with that 'baby i'm right here' smile and it would've felt like a million little shining stars had just aligned and i would've been so happy christmas lights glisten i've got my eye on the door just waiting for you to walk in but the time is ticking people ask me how i've been as i comb back through my memory how you said you'd be here you said you'd be here and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all laughing as i'm looking around the room but there was one thing missing and that was the moment i knew and the hours pass by now i just wanna be alone but your close friends always seem to know when there's something really wrong so they follow me down the hall and there in the bathroom i try not to fall apart and the sinking feeling starts as i say hopelessly he said he'd be here and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all laughing and asking me about you but there was one thing missing and that was the moment i knew what do you say when tears are streaming down your face in front of everyone you know and what do you do when the one who means the most to you is the one who didn't show you should've been here and i would've been so happy and it was like slow motion standing there in my party dress in red lipstick with no one to impress and they're all standing around me singing happy birthday to you but there was one thing missing and that was the moment i knew oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh i knew oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh you call me later and said i'm sorry i didn't make it and i said i'm sorry too and that was the moment i knew in the heat of the fight i walked away ignoring words that you were saying trying to make me stay i said 'this time i've had enough' and you've called a hundred times but i'm not picking up cause i'm so mad i might tell you that it's over but if you look a little closer i said leave but all i really want is you to stand outside my window throwing pebbles screaming 'i'm in love with you' wait there in the pouring rain come back for more and don't you leave cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone going through the photographs staring at the phone i keep going back over things we both said and i remember the slamming door and all the things that i misread so babe if you know everything tell me why you couldn't see when i left i wanted you to chase after me yeah i said leave but all i really want is you to stand outside my window throwing pebbles screaming 'i'm in love with you' wait there in the pouring rain come back for more and don't you leave cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door and i'll scream out the window i can't even look at you i don't need you but i do i do i do i say there's nothing you can say to make this right i mean it i mean it what i mean is i said leave but baby all i want is you to stand outside my window throwing pebbles screaming 'i'm in love with you' wait there in the pouring rain come back for more and don't you leave cause i know all i need is on the other side of the door with your face and the beautiful eyes and the conversation with the little white lies and the faded picture of a beautiful night you carry me from your car to the stairs and i broke down crying was she worth this mess after everything and that little black dress after everything i must confess i need you i didn't know what i would find when i went looking for a reason i know i didn't read between the lines and baby i've got nowhere to go i tried to take the road less traveled by but nothing seems to work the first few times am i right so how can i ever try to be better nobody ever lets me in i can still see you this ain't the best view on the outside looking in i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside you saw me there but never knew i would give it all up to be a part of this a part of you and now it's all too late so you see you could've helped if you had wanted to but no one notices until it's too late to do anything so how can i ever try to be better nobody ever lets me in i can still see you this ain't the best view on the outside looking in i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside so how can i ever try to be better nobody ever lets me in i can still see you this ain't the best view on the outside looking in i've been a lot of lonely places i've never been on the outside should have been different but it wasn't different was it same old story dear john and so long should have fit like a glove should have fit like a ring like a diamond ring a token of true love should have all worked out but it didn't she should be here now but she isn't there's your trouble there's your trouble you keep seeing double with the wrong one you can't see i love you you can't see she doesn't but you just keep holding on there's your trouble so now you're thinking 'bout all you're missing how deep you're sinking round and round and dragging down why don't you cash in your chips why don't you call it a loss not such a big loss chalk it up better luck could have been true love but it wasn't it should all add up but it doesn't should have all worked out but it didn't she should be here now but she isn't i used to think one day we'd tell the story of us how we met and the sparks flew instantly and people would say they're the lucky ones i used to know my place was a spot next to you now i'm searching the room for an empty seat 'cause lately i don't even know what page you're on oh a simple complication miscommunications lead to fallout so many things that i wish you knew so many walls up that i can't break through now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me yeah i don't know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now next chapter how'd we end up this way see me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy and you're doing your best to avoid me i'm starting to think one day i'll tell the story of us of how i was losing my mind when i saw you here but you held your pride like you should have held me oh i'm scared to see the ending why are we pretending this is nothing i'd tell you i miss you but i don't know how i've never heard silence quite this loud now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me yeah and i don't know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now this is looking like a contest of who can act like they care less but i liked it better when you were on my side the battle's in your hands now but i would lay my armor down if you say you'd rather love than fight so many things that you wish i knew but the story of us might be ending soon now i'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me yeah and i don't know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now now now and we're not speaking and i'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me yeah and i don't know what to say since a twist of fate because we're going down and the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now the end if i could be sweet i would but first of all let me say i must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way cause i've been acting like sour milk all on the floor its your fault you didn't shut the refrigerator maybe that's the reason i've been acting so cold if i could escape and recreate a place that's my own world and i could be your favorite girl forever perfectly together now tell me

sweet escape sweet escape let go of the ones who hurt you let go of the ones you outgrow let go of the words they hurl your way as you re walking out the door the only thing cut and dry in this hedge maze life is the fact that their words will cut but your tears will dry they don t tell you this when you are young you can t hold on to everything can t show up for everyone you pick your poison or your cure phone numbers you know by heart and the ones you don t answer any more hold on to the faint recognition in the eye of a stranger as it catches you in its lustrous net how quickly we become intertwined how wonderful it is to forget all the times your intuition failed you but it hasn t killed you yet hold on to childlike whims and moonlight swims and your blazing self respect and if you drive the roads of this town ones you ve gone down so many times before flashback to all the times life nearly ran you off the road but tonight your hand is steady suddenly you ll know the trick to holding on was all that letting go he is sensible and so incredible and all my single friends are jealous he says everything i need to hear and it's like i couldn't ask for anything better he opens up my door and i get into his car and he says you look beautiful tonight and i feel perfectly fine but i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain and it's am and i'm cursing your name you're so in love that you act insane and that's the way i loved you breaking down and coming undone it's a roller coaster kind of rush and i never knew i could feel that much and that's the way i loved you he respects my space and never makes me wait and he calls exactly when he says he will he's close to my mother talks business with my father he's charming and endearing and i'm comfortable he can't see the smile i'm faking and my heart's not breaking 'cause i'm not feeling anything at all and you were wild and crazy just so frustrating intoxicating complicated got away by some mistake and now i miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain it's am and i'm cursing your name i'm so in love that i acted insane and that's the way i loved you breaking down and coming undone it's a roller coaster kind of rush and i never knew i could feel that much and that's the way i loved you oh oh and that's the way i loved you oh oh never knew i could feel that much and that's the way i loved you stumble up the porch step you sat down in the car only thirteen blocks across this town to get to where you are and that don t offer me much time to make up my mind so i best be driving slow on my way to letting go these headlights they just wanna fade off into the night but if they re half as stubborn as me they ll just keep on shining bright i ain t ever been one to settle like the dust does on the dash since the feeling ain t strong i ll just move on and leave this in my past once you're gone i know your memory'll somehow get the best of me so i question everything i do unsure of turning you away wondering love how i ll act today until you find somebody new so i ve been holding on way too long but not another minute i'm gonna miss you bad but can t call it love if you ain t in it red light turns to green then back to red again i wish there were some other travelers out here to slow my travelling even though the wheel rolled on inside i still don t know oh and it troubles me so

holding on way too long but not another minute i might miss you bad but can t call it love if you ain t in it your car comes to a rest in the drive you open up the door and i see you smile walking

screamed and ran after it and tried to open the door and it ran over your foot and i was too busy laughing on the ground to see it would take brad pitt to leave you it takes five seconds to need you when i'm mad at all the lovebirds 'cause they don't know to play our song i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 'cause that's where you belong until brad pitt comes along do you remember the time we watched carrie and you said it reminded you of me and i threw the remote at you and you said my point exactly and later on that night under the neon city lights you paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me it would take brad pitt to leave you it takes five seconds to need you when i'm mad at all the lovebirds 'cause they don't know to play our song i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 'cause that's where you belong until brad pitt comes along you call me lucky 'cause i lose everything but i swear i'd be careful with it if you gave me a ring it would take brad pitt to leave you it takes five seconds to need you when i'm mad at all the lovebirds 'cause they don't know to play our song i wish that pretty girls couldn't see you i wish that all your roads would lead you right to me 'cause that's where you belong until brad pitt comes along he said the way my blue eyes shined put those georgia stars to shame that night i said that's a lie just a boy in a chevy truck that had a tendency of gettin' stuck on backroads at night and i was right there beside him all summer long and then the time we woke up to find that summer gone but when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song the one we danced to all night long the moon like a spotlight on the lake when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me september saw a month of tears and thankin' god that you weren't here to see me like that but in a box beneath my bed is a letter that you never read from three summers back it's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet and lookin' back on all of that it's nice to believe when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song the one we danced to all night long the moon like a spotlight on the lake when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me and i'm back for the first time since then i'm standin' on your street and there's a letter left on your doorstep and the first thing that you'll read is when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think my favorite song someday you'll turn your radio on i hope it takes you back to that place when you think happiness i hope you think that little black dress think of my head on your chest and my old faded blue jeans when you think tim mcgraw i hope you think of me oh think of me mmmm he said the way my blue eyes shine put those georgia stars to shame that night i said that's a lie i write this to explain why i ll be holding back my album from the new streaming service apple music i feel this deserves an explanation because apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans i respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries i m sure you are aware that apple music will be offering a free month trial to anyone who signs up for the service i m not sure you know that apple music will not be paying writers producers or artists for those three months i find it to be shocking disappointing and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company this is not about me thankfully i am on my fifth album and can support myself my band crew and entire management team by playing live shows this is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success this is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt this is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create just like the innovators and creators at apple are pioneering in their field but will not get paid for a quarter of a year s worth of plays on his or her songs these are not the complaints of a spoiled petulant child these are the echoed sentiments of every artist writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect apple so much we simply do not respect this particular call i realize that apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming i think that is beautiful progress we know how astronomically successful apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists writers and producers for the month trial period even if it is free for the fans trying it out three months is a long time to go unpaid and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing i say this with love reverence and admiration for everything else apple has done i hope that soon i can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music i think this could be the platform that gets it right but i say to apple with all due respect it s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this we don t ask you for free iphones please don t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation taylor today was a fairytale you were the prince i used to be a damsel in distress you took me by the hand and you picked me up at six today was a fairytale today was a fairytale today was a fairytale i wore a dress you

of salt pillars of sand i hear jerusalem bells a ringing roman cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field for some reason i can't explain once you go there was never never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world it was a wicked and wild wind blew down the doors to let me in shattered windows and the sound of drums people couldn't believe what i'd become revolutionaries wait for my head on a silver plate just a puppet on a lonely string oh who would ever wanna be king i hear jerusalem bells a ringing roman cavalry choirs are singing be my mirror my sword and shield my missionaries in a foreign field for some reason i can't explain i know saint peter won't call my name never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world for some reason i can't explain i know saint peter won't call my name never an honest word but that was when i ruled the world if you had only gotten to me first if i could write a book on how

in the position that make me feel so oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh make you feel unpretty too that's another song by an artist from philly i wanna see if you know it when she fell she fell apart cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated as a child with sidewalk chalk when she crashed her clothes disintegrated and blew away with the winds that took all of her fair weather friends when she looked around her skin was spattered with ink forming the words of a thousand voices echoes she heard even in her sleep whatever you say it is not right whatever you do it is not enough your kindness is fake your pain is manipulative when she lay there on the ground she dreamed of time machines and revenge and a love that was really something not just the idea of something when she finally rose she rose slowly avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies wary of phone calls and promises charmers dandies and get love quick schemes when she stood she stood with a desolate knowingness waded out into the dark wild ocean up to her neck bathed in her brokenness said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor she never knew she needed standing broad shouldered next

the way home way home you you can see it with the lights out lights out you are in love true love you are in love morning his place burnt toast sunday you keep his shirt he keeps his word and for once you let go of your fears and your ghosts one step not much but it said enough you kiss on side walks you fight and you talk one night he wakes strange look on his face pauses then says you're my best friend and you knew what it was he is in love you can hear it in the silence silence you you can feel it on the way home way home you you can see it with the lights out lights out you are in love true love and so it goes you two are dancing in the snowglobe round and round and he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown and you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars and

your worn out jeans i can't help thinking this is how it ought to be laughing on a park bench thinking to myself hey isn't this easy and you've got a smile that could light up this whole town i

every space in every room and i know that if i turn around you won't be there if i close my eyes will you be there i don't want to lose your face and i don't want to wake one day and not remember what time erased and i don't want to turn around because i m not scared of what love gave me and took away and i don't want to lose your face i've got a picture of you in my bedroom and i hope it never falls and i hope i never lose that feeling i used to get when you would call and now i wonder to myself who were you and where are you were you ever here at all that girl in the song had it so good i wish i could close my eyes and see you i wish the sky had your face and the oceans had your eyes and the sunset had your lips and i had you
