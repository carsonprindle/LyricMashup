       "   'lyrics': 'Zane Lowe: Grab a seat, grab a seat. So, you remember this place? Graduation? I was also thinking about some of the other things we\\'ve done as well with the BBC, like Abbey Road sprung to mind with the strings.\\nKanye West: Oh yeah. That was good. That suit was like, I would\\'ve worn something different if I could look back right now. I could still do a suit, I just wouldn\\'t have done that exact lapel situation.\\nZL: But talk about really putting yourself on the line with that. That was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and to give yourself that objective. What are your thoughts when you think back about Abbey Road, where...it\\'s just nuts.\\nKW: I thought it was good. I thought it was what I was supposed to do at that time. If I see something, if I see an opportunity, I\\'m gonna go for it. We\\'re all gonna die one day.\\nZL: Yeah, that\\'s true.\\nKW: So live like that. Live like you could die tomorrow. Go for it. Those steps have been the platforms that allowed me to make it this far.\\nZL: And you have, man, and you\\'re here. Six original albums of your own, a Throne record, various records with G.O.O.D. Music to talk about. But seriously, man, Yeezus. Bravo, dude. I mean, that is one of the most creative records of any genre I\\'ve heard in a very, very long time, and just in terms of your output, your most exciting-sounding record, I think.\\nKW: Oh, thank you very much. Yeah, I feel I was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again, not having to speak with the textures of the time. Cause, you know, Cruel Summer is definitely Kanye West, and there\\'s something weird and kind of off about \"Mercy,\" like when it has the high-pitched (impersonates noise), that type of sound. It sounds like art still a little bit, even though it obviously was a radio smash.\\nBut when I get into the idea, the trap drums and things like that, certain songs that are blatant radio hits, it\\'s like I\\'m speaking with today\\'s textures. If you look at it 200 years from now, it\\'s not going to stand out in the way that 808s or Yeezus stands out, and can completely push or redefine or make people say, hey, I completely hate that, or I completely love that, but let me just think differently. Because everybody is bound to these -- no pun intended -- they\\'re bound to sixteen bars or eight bars, and the normal radio thing.\\nI was talking to Frank Ocean about this, and said, my mom got arrested for the sit-ins, and now we\\'re more like the sit-outs. Like, sit off of radio, and say, hey radio, come to us. We need to find something new, because it\\'s being controlled in a way, and manufactured in a way, that really awesome artists can make amazing music and not break as far past as, like, something that\\'s very formulaic.\\nZL: So it almost feels like a duty to you in a weird way? Having the peoples\\' ear, having peoples\\' attention for great music, to be able to say, well, if I\\'m not challenging them enough, I\\'m not challenging myself, not challenging radio, what am I doing?\\nKW: Yeah. I\\'m not trying to regurgitate myself. I showed people that I understand how to make perfect. Dark Fantasy could be considered to be perfect. I know how to make perfect. But that\\'s not what I\\'m here to do. I\\'m here to crack the pavement and make new grounds, sonically and society, culturally.\\nZL: You\\'ve done that with Yeezus. It\\'s fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now, because normally when I talk to artists about records of this nature, it\\'s in the lead-up to something. So we\\'re all kind of playing a guessing game, you know what I mean? You could tell me what you think of the record, but I\\'m trying to find my way around it, the audience probably won\\'t have heard it. In this case, it\\'s been out for a minute, so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight, too. You\\'ve seen what everyone else has had to say about this record, both good and bad. But I\\'m fascinated to know, today, how you would describe Yeezus, as someone who made it. How you would describe that record.\\nKW: I just think that I\\'m a production person, I\\'m a product guy, I\\'m a producer. So if I\\'m working on a John Legend album, I\\'m gonna try to give John Legend the best home for him to stay in. And I\\'m gonna try to push Pusha T -- no pun intended once again, this keeps happening to me -- to make the thing that represents what I like about his music the most. And then for me as Kanye West, I gotta fuck shit up.\\nZL: And you did, dude, seriously. From the minute it starts. I mean, seriously. (Plays opening to \"On Sight\"). It\\'s disgusting.\\nSo you\\'re up in the loft probably at this point, and you\\'re kicking around ideas, and you\\'re putting things together, and this sound comes into your head, and you\\'re like, this is what I\\'m looking for?\\nKW: Nah. This is me going to the studio with Thomas and Guy-Manuel, who\\'s Daft Punk. They had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there. This is just one session right here. This beat was originally like 14 minutes long, and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted, and I ended up making that the intro.\\nZL: You know, I got a beef with you over this track. It\\'s too short! I wanted more out of it. Cause it\\'s one of the best beats on the record for me, and it feels like you\\'re just getting warmed up. Was that kind of deliberate, to pull back after only a couple of verses and go, you know what, we\\'re going to get on with the album now?\\nKW: Nah, it\\'s just what I felt, like it should be.\\nZL: Just a dance thing.\\nKW: And you know, originally \"Blood on the Leaves\" was supposed to be first.\\nZL: Wow.\\nKW: Which, psychologically, I know would have changed certain Yeezus naysayers about the album. It wasn\\'t that time for me. I didn\\'t want to come up there and perform. A lot of times, music can be presented as a service position. But I wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music.\\nYou know, people go on a vacation and say, you got the drugs, you got the music, you got the wine? It\\'s in that territory. But I wanted to speak up and say, okay, so my voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music. It\\'s the only place where I actually have a deal, so I can only consistently make things in music. So I\\'m gonna take music and I\\'m gonna try to make it three-dimensional, like on Star Wars and the hologram\\'ll pop up out of R2D2. I\\'m gonna try to make something that jumps up and affects you, in a good or bad way. Whether it\\'s, I\\'m going into a scream in the middle of the track because that\\'s just the way I feel. But I\\'m not here to make easy listening, easy programmable music.\\nZL: No. You\\'re so off the reservation on this album in the best possible way. Like you talked about, the way you use your voice in different ways, you don\\'t rely on conventional rhyming flows. Your opening line, \"Yeezus season approaching,\" you know? \"A monster\\'s awoken.\" You\\'re laying it out there, this isn\\'t My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy part 2. I\\'m wilding out on this record, straight away.\\n(Plays interlude from \"On Sight\"). And then from nowhere as well, we just get treated to these wonderful moments where, like you say, it\\'s almost like a collage. Like you\\'re sitting here going, you know, why can\\'t I go into this? Why not?\\nKW: You can.\\nZL: And you did.\\nKW: That\\'s how life is. It\\'s like a car crash. You could just be driving, and just out of nowhere it happens.\\nZL: At what point did that very deliberate feel to the record, whereby breaks come in and join this really discordant electronic moments and everything seems to exist in this very contradictory but it works kind of way, at what point did that start to take shape? Because it is very omnipresent through the record as a whole, the way it flips between one and the other. Was that in your head early on, or did that come towards the end when you started to reduce the record?\\nKW: Well, I didn\\'t reduce it. Rick Rubin reduced it. He\\'s not a producer, he\\'s a reducer. (Laughs).\\nZL: But was it always part of the process for you, to say, why don\\'t I take elements of this and this and just (claps hands together) bolt it together?\\nKW: Yeah. It\\'s just the way I was consuming information in my life at the time. Negative information to positive information, from the Internet, just going to the Louvre, going to furniture exhibits and understanding that, trying to open up and do interviews like this, learning more about architecture. Taking one thousand meetings, attempting to get backing to do clothing and different things like that. Getting no headway whatsoever. It was just that level of frustration. This is what frustration fucking sounds like.\\nThis is what frustration sounds like. For me, as Kanye West, I would not be Kanye West if it wasn\\'t for Michael Jackson. I was with Quincy Jones a couple days ago at John Legend\\'s wedding. Quincy was telling me, it wasn\\'t just Mike, but these guys broke down the barriers. Of course you know Michael Jackson, he had to fight to get his video played because he was black. This is Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson\\'s not even black, he\\'s Michael Jackson -- you know what I mean? He\\'s so crazy, how can he even be classified as this black artist?\\nSo for me, in my life and creativity it\\'s been challenging and everything. But I was able to ascend to massive heights because of the foundation that my mother and my father and my grandfather laid through civil rights, what Michael Jackson did with music videos and the ground he broke. There would be no Kanye West if it wasn\\'t for Michael Jackson - that allowed him to be that, right?\\nNow let\\'s take people who have issues with me as Kanye West. They classify my motivational speeches as rants - like \"Why is he saying that? Why is he doing that?\" Well I\\'ve reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. And I\\'ve got to a point that Michael Jackson did not break down. I have reached the glass ceiling - as a creative person, as a celebrity.\\nWhen I say that it means I want to do product. I am a product person. Not just clothing but water bottle design, architecture, everything that you could think about. And I\\'ve been at it for 10 years, and I look around and I say, \"Hey wait a second - there\\'s no one around here in this space that looks like me.\" And if they are, they\\'re quiet as fuck!\\nSo that means - wait a second - now we\\'re seriously in a Civil Rights movement. Like people used to joke about - remember our South Park photo - remember how funny that was? Do you think there would be a Givenchy in the hood if it wasn\\'t for that South Park photo. But no one thinks about that - no one thinks about the names I got called for wearing tight jeans.\\nZL: You reference that in the record, you talk about that. \"No one\\'s liked him since he\\'s been wearing tight jeans.\" Everybody knows you brought back real rap. I mean you reference that in the record.\\nKW: I\\'m saying y\\'all had all that, but I brought real rap back. I\\'m going to do dope things. And I wanna take this opportunity to speak to something, because I go to Hypebeast sometimes to look at the new things that\\'re coming out. And every time my name goes up, there\\'s a series of people who write just negative comments - they wanna joke around and say, \"Why is he still trying? Why is he doing this?\" They like diss me as a person for trying. Now mind you, I\\'ve brought 10 years of product that has added to humanity.\\nAnd now, what they don\\'t realize when I say \"Hey this is Pusha T, this is what it is\" I have to remind Pusha T that he\\'s Pusha T. Because the radio, if they\\'re not playing a song of his that has an R&B hook on it or works at a certain level of trap tempo and plays in clubs, it\\'s like we forget about that Clipse album that meant everything.\\nAnd the reason why I relate it to design and what we do in design is saying that\\'s the music that us as creatives that wanted to get into design - we looked at Clipse as the gods, and this is our soundtrack to creativity. And it\\'s not a trap beat that comes in on that soundtrack to creativity. No knock to trap, cause I did \"Can\\'t Tell Me Nothing\" - I like it. But it\\'s been commercialized to the point where - and I\\'m not mentioning no names - but people used to use the term \"R&B nigga\" but then it was \"rappers.\" But then rappers didn\\'t wanna be no R&B nigga. Now the rappers is the new R&B niggas! The rapper\\'s the new radio! Like where\\'s the culture at? Where is the culture at?\\nSo then I scream - and I\\'m sitting in the middle of it - whether I\\'m at a dinner with Anna Wintour, or I\\'m at a listening session with Pusha, or me and Virgil are in Rome giving designs to Fendi over and over and gettin\\' our designs knocked down. Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no. How many motherfuckers you done seen with a leather jogging pant? Meaning when I see Hedi Slimane and it\\'s all like, \"OK this is my take on the world\" - yeah he got some nice $5,000 jeans in there, some nice ones here and there, some good shit here and there.\\nBut we culture. Rap the new rock n\\' roll! We culture! Rap is the new rock n\\' roll! We the rock stars!\\nZL: It\\'s been like that now for a minute.\\nKW: It\\'s been like that for a minute, Hedi Slimane! It\\'s been like that for a minute. We the real rock stars, and I\\'m the biggest of all of \\'em. I\\'m the number one rock star on the planet.\\nCLICK HERE FOR PART 2',\n",

       "    'lyrics': 'Zane Lowe: Grab a seat, grab a seat. So, you remember this place? Graduation? I was also thinking about some of the other things we\\'ve done as well with the BBC, like Abbey Road sprung to mind with the strings.\\nKanye West: Oh yeah. That was good. That suit was like, I would\\'ve worn something different if I could look back right now. I could still do a suit, I just wouldn\\'t have done that exact lapel situation.\\nZL: But talk about really putting yourself on the line with that. That was so early on for you to be stepping in a room with that many players and to give yourself that objective. What are your thoughts when you think back about Abbey Road, where...it\\'s just nuts.\\nKW: I thought it was good. I thought it was what I was supposed to do at that time. If I see something, if I see an opportunity, I\\'m gonna go for it. We\\'re all gonna die one day.\\nZL: Yeah, that\\'s true.\\nKW: So live like that. Live like you could die tomorrow. Go for it. Those steps have been the platforms that allowed me to make it this far.\\nZL: And you have, man, and you\\'re here. Six original albums of your own, a Throne record, various records with G.O.O.D. Music to talk about. But seriously, man, Yeezus. Bravo, dude. I mean, that is one of the most creative records of any genre I\\'ve heard in a very, very long time, and just in terms of your output, your most exciting-sounding record, I think.\\nKW: Oh, thank you very much. Yeah, I feel I was able to start making exactly what was in my mind again, not having to speak with the textures of the time. Cause, you know, Cruel Summer is definitely Kanye West, and there\\'s something weird and kind of off about \"Mercy,\" like when it has the high-pitched (impersonates noise), that type of sound. It sounds like art still a little bit, even though it obviously was a radio smash.\\nBut when I get into the idea, the trap drums and things like that, certain songs that are blatant radio hits, it\\'s like I\\'m speaking with today\\'s textures. If you look at it 200 years from now, it\\'s not going to stand out in the way that 808s or Yeezus stands out, and can completely push or redefine or make people say, hey, I completely hate that, or I completely love that, but let me just think differently. Because everybody is bound to these -- no pun intended -- they\\'re bound to sixteen bars or eight bars, and the normal radio thing.\\nI was talking to Frank Ocean about this, and said, my mom got arrested for the sit-ins, and now we\\'re more like the sit-outs. Like, sit off of radio, and say, hey radio, come to us. We need to find something new, because it\\'s being controlled in a way, and manufactured in a way, that really awesome artists can make amazing music and not break as far past as, like, something that\\'s very formulaic.\\nZL: So it almost feels like a duty to you in a weird way? Having the peoples\\' ear, having peoples\\' attention for great music, to be able to say, well, if I\\'m not challenging them enough, I\\'m not challenging myself, not challenging radio, what am I doing?\\nKW: Yeah. I\\'m not trying to regurgitate myself. I showed people that I understand how to make perfect. Dark Fantasy could be considered to be perfect. I know how to make perfect. But that\\'s not what I\\'m here to do. I\\'m here to crack the pavement and make new grounds, sonically and society, culturally.\\nZL: You\\'ve done that with Yeezus. It\\'s fascinating for us to sit here and talk about this record now, because normally when I talk to artists about records of this nature, it\\'s in the lead-up to something. So we\\'re all kind of playing a guessing game, you know what I mean? You could tell me what you think of the record, but I\\'m trying to find my way around it, the audience probably won\\'t have heard it. In this case, it\\'s been out for a minute, so we can reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight, too. You\\'ve seen what everyone else has had to say about this record, both good and bad. But I\\'m fascinated to know, today, how you would describe Yeezus, as someone who made it. How you would describe that record.\\nKW: I just think that I\\'m a production person, I\\'m a product guy, I\\'m a producer. So if I\\'m working on a John Legend album, I\\'m gonna try to give John Legend the best home for him to stay in. And I\\'m gonna try to push Pusha T -- no pun intended once again, this keeps happening to me -- to make the thing that represents what I like about his music the most. And then for me as Kanye West, I gotta fuck shit up.\\nZL: And you did, dude, seriously. From the minute it starts. I mean, seriously. (Plays opening to \"On Sight\"). It\\'s disgusting.\\nSo you\\'re up in the loft probably at this point, and you\\'re kicking around ideas, and you\\'re putting things together, and this sound comes into your head, and you\\'re like, this is what I\\'m looking for?\\nKW: Nah. This is me going to the studio with Thomas and Guy-Manuel, who\\'s Daft Punk. They had a synthesizer the size of that wall right there. This is just one session right here. This beat was originally like 14 minutes long, and that part in the beginning was something we completely just distorted, and I ended up making that the intro.\\nZL: You know, I got a beef with you over this track. It\\'s too short! I wanted more out of it. Cause it\\'s one of the best beats on the record for me, and it feels like you\\'re just getting warmed up. Was that kind of deliberate, to pull back after only a couple of verses and go, you know what, we\\'re going to get on with the album now?\\nKW: Nah, it\\'s just what I felt, like it should be.\\nZL: Just a dance thing.\\nKW: And you know, originally \"Blood on the Leaves\" was supposed to be first.\\nZL: Wow.\\nKW: Which, psychologically, I know would have changed certain Yeezus naysayers about the album. It wasn\\'t that time for me. I didn\\'t want to come up there and perform. A lot of times, music can be presented as a service position. But I wanted to take a more aggressive approach with music.\\nYou know, people go on a vacation and say, you got the drugs, you got the music, you got the wine? It\\'s in that territory. But I wanted to speak up and say, okay, so my voice is only compressed to express myself artistically through music. It\\'s the only place where I actually have a deal, so I can only consistently make things in music. So I\\'m gonna take music and I\\'m gonna try to make it three-dimensional, like on Star Wars and the hologram\\'ll pop up out of R2D2. I\\'m gonna try to make something that jumps up and affects you, in a good or bad way. Whether it\\'s, I\\'m going into a scream in the middle of the track because that\\'s just the way I feel. But I\\'m not here to make easy listening, easy programmable music.\\nZL: No. You\\'re so off the reservation on this album in the best possible way. Like you talked about, the way you use your voice in different ways, you don\\'t rely on conventional rhyming flows. Your opening line, \"Yeezus season approaching,\" you know? \"A monster\\'s awoken.\" You\\'re laying it out there, this isn\\'t My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy part 2. I\\'m wilding out on this record, straight away.\\n(Plays interlude from \"On Sight\"). And then from nowhere as well, we just get treated to these wonderful moments where, like you say, it\\'s almost like a collage. Like you\\'re sitting here going, you know, why can\\'t I go into this? Why not?\\nKW: You can.\\nZL: And you did.\\nKW: That\\'s how life is. It\\'s like a car crash. You could just be driving, and just out of nowhere it happens.\\nZL: At what point did that very deliberate feel to the record, whereby breaks come in and join this really discordant electronic moments and everything seems to exist in this very contradictory but it works kind of way, at what point did that start to take shape? Because it is very omnipresent through the record as a whole, the way it flips between one and the other. Was that in your head early on, or did that come towards the end when you started to reduce the record?\\nKW: Well, I didn\\'t reduce it. Rick Rubin reduced it. He\\'s not a producer, he\\'s a reducer. (Laughs).\\nZL: But was it always part of the process for you, to say, why don\\'t I take elements of this and this and just (claps hands together) bolt it together?\\nKW: Yeah. It\\'s just the way I was consuming information in my life at the time. Negative information to positive information, from the Internet, just going to the Louvre, going to furniture exhibits and understanding that, trying to open up and do interviews like this, learning more about architecture. Taking one thousand meetings, attempting to get backing to do clothing and different things like that. Getting no headway whatsoever. It was just that level of frustration. This is what frustration fucking sounds like.\\nThis is what frustration sounds like. For me, as Kanye West, I would not be Kanye West if it wasn\\'t for Michael Jackson. I was with Quincy Jones a couple days ago at John Legend\\'s wedding. Quincy was telling me, it wasn\\'t just Mike, but these guys broke down the barriers. Of course you know Michael Jackson, he had to fight to get his video played because he was black. This is Michael Jackson. Michael Jackson\\'s not even black, he\\'s Michael Jackson -- you know what I mean? He\\'s so crazy, how can he even be classified as this black artist?\\nSo for me, in my life and creativity it\\'s been challenging and everything. But I was able to ascend to massive heights because of the foundation that my mother and my father and my grandfather laid through civil rights, what Michael Jackson did with music videos and the ground he broke. There would be no Kanye West if it wasn\\'t for Michael Jackson - that allowed him to be that, right?\\nNow let\\'s take people who have issues with me as Kanye West. They classify my motivational speeches as rants - like \"Why is he saying that? Why is he doing that?\" Well I\\'ve reached a point in my life where my Truman Show boat has hit the painting. And I\\'ve got to a point that Michael Jackson did not break down. I have reached the glass ceiling - as a creative person, as a celebrity.\\nWhen I say that it means I want to do product. I am a product person. Not just clothing but water bottle design, architecture, everything that you could think about. And I\\'ve been at it for 10 years, and I look around and I say, \"Hey wait a second - there\\'s no one around here in this space that looks like me.\" And if they are, they\\'re quiet as fuck!\\nSo that means - wait a second - now we\\'re seriously in a Civil Rights movement. Like people used to joke about - remember our South Park photo - remember how funny that was? Do you think there would be a Givenchy in the hood if it wasn\\'t for that South Park photo. But no one thinks about that - no one thinks about the names I got called for wearing tight jeans.\\nZL: You reference that in the record, you talk about that. \"No one\\'s liked him since he\\'s been wearing tight jeans.\" Everybody knows you brought back real rap. I mean you reference that in the record.\\nKW: I\\'m saying y\\'all had all that, but I brought real rap back. I\\'m going to do dope things. And I wanna take this opportunity to speak to something, because I go to Hypebeast sometimes to look at the new things that\\'re coming out. And every time my name goes up, there\\'s a series of people who write just negative comments - they wanna joke around and say, \"Why is he still trying? Why is he doing this?\" They like diss me as a person for trying. Now mind you, I\\'ve brought 10 years of product that has added to humanity.\\nAnd now, what they don\\'t realize when I say \"Hey this is Pusha T, this is what it is\" I have to remind Pusha T that he\\'s Pusha T. Because the radio, if they\\'re not playing a song of his that has an R&B hook on it or works at a certain level of trap tempo and plays in clubs, it\\'s like we forget about that Clipse album that meant everything.\\nAnd the reason why I relate it to design and what we do in design is saying that\\'s the music that us as creatives that wanted to get into design - we looked at Clipse as the gods, and this is our soundtrack to creativity. And it\\'s not a trap beat that comes in on that soundtrack to creativity. No knock to trap, cause I did \"Can\\'t Tell Me Nothing\" - I like it. But it\\'s been commercialized to the point where - and I\\'m not mentioning no names - but people used to use the term \"R&B nigga\" but then it was \"rappers.\" But then rappers didn\\'t wanna be no R&B nigga. Now the rappers is the new R&B niggas! The rapper\\'s the new radio! Like where\\'s the culture at? Where is the culture at?\\nSo then I scream - and I\\'m sitting in the middle of it - whether I\\'m at a dinner with Anna Wintour, or I\\'m at a listening session with Pusha, or me and Virgil are in Rome giving designs to Fendi over and over and gettin\\' our designs knocked down. Brought the leather jogging pants 6 years ago to Fendi, and they said no. How many motherfuckers you done seen with a leather jogging pant? Meaning when I see Hedi Slimane and it\\'s all like, \"OK this is my take on the world\" - yeah he got some nice $5,000 jeans in there, some nice ones here and there, some good shit here and there.\\nBut we culture. Rap the new rock n\\' roll! We culture! Rap is the new rock n\\' roll! We the rock stars!\\nZL: It\\'s been like that now for a minute.\\nKW: It\\'s been like that for a minute, Hedi Slimane! It\\'s been like that for a minute. We the real rock stars, and I\\'m the biggest of all of \\'em. I\\'m the number one rock star on the planet.\\nCLICK HERE FOR PART 2',\n",

       "   'lyrics': 'Kanye West: We the real rockstars and I\\'m the biggest of all of them. I\\'m the biggest rock star on the planet.\\nZane Lowe: There it is. That record- it says that. That\\'s what your album says when you come out, and there are songs on there where you make it very clear.\\nKW: So what I want to explain to everybody out there, it\\'s like, I make music I can do it, but I shouldn\\'t be limited to only one place of creativity. And it\\'s literally only like one of two reason why I haven\\'t been able to break that down.\\nZL: But why should you feel that you are? Because-\\nKW: No! This is the thing you guys don\\'t understand. You guys don\\'t understand. You guys don\\'t understand that I did the Yeezys and they EBAY\\'d for 90 thousand dollars and people wanted them bad as whatever, right? But I didn\\'t get a call from Nike the next day. You guys don\\'t understand that I\\'ve met with companies and they say, \"What we\\'re trying to figure out is how we can control you and control that\". If you\\'re an architect and you\\'re a world builder and you have all these ideas and you\\'re Gaudi, and you want to build buildings, if you don\\'t ever get that out, what\\'s gonna happen?\\nZL: Isn\\'t that why you do it? Isn\\'t it the process? Isn\\'t it point to do it?\\nKW: I don\\'t think you\\'re really hearing what I\\'m saying.\\nZL: I\\'m trying to\\nKW: As a creative, for you to have done something to the level of the Yeezys and not be able to create more and you cannot- you cannot create that on your own, with no support, with no backing. So when I say \"clean water was only served to the fairer skinned\" what I\\'m saying is we\\'re making products with chitlins. T-SHIRTS! That\\'s the most we can make! T-shirts. We could have our best perspective on t-shirts. But if it\\'s anything else...\\n*HAND SMACK*\\nyour Truman Show boat is hitting the wall. And what\\'s more important to me about this than everything I can do sonically and everything is, if I go somewhere else and someone says, \"Hey, we don\\'t like Kanye West\" you\\'ve heard that before, right? What people don\\'t realize is I want to make uniforms for my high school basketball team through Brand Yeezy. I want to make that one step, and then make another step, and eventually do uniforms for the entire city, then I want those uniforms to be hot and make money, then I eventually want to be the anchor and the force behind a billion dollar company and after I make that billion dollar step, then I can go in and say I have an opinion on this and that could be a ten billion dollar step, I eventually want to be the anchor of the first trillion dollar company. But when you sit and you have a meeting with a company and show them the most innovate take on theatre because you thought of it one night when you were sitting on top of Watch The Throne set which you designed with Es Devlin, and I designed the set with Es Devlin and thought of, \"Ok, surround vision, there should be a screen above you, below you, to the left, to the right of you and one in front of you also\" then I paid my own money that I get paid for doing Gold Digger, which I never really liked that song but I always knew I would get paid for doing Gold Digger, then I shoot a film in Qatar with three camera crews, with Nate Brown, Virgil, Matt Williams, Nabil, all of these crew- all of the people that every video that pops up every other day on Hypebeast thats my crew, right? So, we go out and shoot that, 3 camera crews over 5 days edited over 30 days, show it at amfAR- no, show it in Cannes, the night before amfAR on the beach, build it in a pyramid with Rem Koolhaas\\' agency, design the entire thing, put editors in it, blah blah blah, people give a standing ovation, I do an interview in New York Times the next year to say, \"Hey, I did this and I want to let you know I did it\", right? And then, it doesn\\'t get mentioned in the interview and a week later they do an interview with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and they\\'re talking about what the next frontier of theatre will be and how it\\'ll be higher priced tickets and it\\'ll be something that\\'s surrounding you and blah blah blah, maybe it\\'s in the goggles, I said, \"Wait a second, I just only did the interview to tell people that I invented it. I made it.\"\\nLike I went, I remember when I was, uh, dropping William Morris, right, and then Sarah Newkirk at that time said \"Before you drop them, go meet with Ari Emanuel\" and I sat with him and I said, \"Ari, I\\'m an inventor\" and he goes on to tell me about the way it works and what he said was \"You are a celebrity. So basically what\\'s going to happen is, there\\'s product here, and this is where you end up, right here. If you can communicate the product you can make money of the product, cause look at Gaga. She\\'s the Creative Director of Polaroid.\" I like some the Gaga songs. What the fuck does she know about cameras? So it becomes all of this thing where all of the musicians- the musicians try to get more money by promoting other products, right? So you\\'ll say \"Hey, you know what? I\\'ve got this water and we\\'ve got, you know, we\\'ve got this red version. We got a red bottle, and we\\'ve got a David Beckham version here, then we got a blue version.\" So my opinion is no more than the patina on top of it, when I understand the reason from my core of why something should work all the way through. So, I understand we want to make it about music but I wanted to take this step to say, we got this new thing called \"Classism\". It\\'s racism\\'s cousin. This is what we do to hold people back. This is what we do. And we got this other thing we got that has been working for a long time where you don\\'t have to be racist anymore it\\'s called \"Self-Hate\"; it works on itself. It\\'s like real estate of racism. Where, just like that, when someone comes up and says something like \"I am a god\", everybody says \"Who does he think he is?\" I just told you who I thought I am, a god! I just told you! That\\'s who I think I am! Would it have been better if I had a song that said, \"I am a nigga\"? or if I had song that said \"I am a gangsta\"? or if I had song that said \"I am a pimp\"? All those color and patinas fit better on a person like me, right? But to say you are a god? Especially, when you got shipped over to the country that you\\'re in, and your last name is a slave owners. How can you say that; how could you have that mentality?\\nZL: I mean, I know in the past you\\'ve talked about, like, you know, building hotels, doing things beyond people\\'s normal frame of reference. They know you as Kanye West, an artist. They know you\\'re moving into fashion, but these things in a way I guess are hard on people to comprehend because they don\\'t have that level of drive. Do you know what I mean? Has it always been like this for you? Have you always felt like you can set your mind on anything and you will achieve it, ultimately?\\nKW: I\\'ve always felt I can do anything. That\\'s the main thing people are controlled by, thoughts- the perceptions of themselves. They\\'re slowed down by the perception of themselves. If you\\'re taught you can\\'t do anything you won\\'t do anything. I was taught I could do everything and I\\'m Kanye West at age 36. So just watch the next ten years.\\nZL: Yea yea yea.',\n",

       "    'lyrics': 'Kanye West: We the real rockstars and I\\'m the biggest of all of them. I\\'m the biggest rock star on the planet.\\nZane Lowe: There it is. That record- it says that. That\\'s what your album says when you come out, and there are songs on there where you make it very clear.\\nKW: So what I want to explain to everybody out there, it\\'s like, I make music I can do it, but I shouldn\\'t be limited to only one place of creativity. And it\\'s literally only like one of two reason why I haven\\'t been able to break that down.\\nZL: But why should you feel that you are? Because-\\nKW: No! This is the thing you guys don\\'t understand. You guys don\\'t understand. You guys don\\'t understand that I did the Yeezys and they EBAY\\'d for 90 thousand dollars and people wanted them bad as whatever, right? But I didn\\'t get a call from Nike the next day. You guys don\\'t understand that I\\'ve met with companies and they say, \"What we\\'re trying to figure out is how we can control you and control that\". If you\\'re an architect and you\\'re a world builder and you have all these ideas and you\\'re Gaudi, and you want to build buildings, if you don\\'t ever get that out, what\\'s gonna happen?\\nZL: Isn\\'t that why you do it? Isn\\'t it the process? Isn\\'t it point to do it?\\nKW: I don\\'t think you\\'re really hearing what I\\'m saying.\\nZL: I\\'m trying to\\nKW: As a creative, for you to have done something to the level of the Yeezys and not be able to create more and you cannot- you cannot create that on your own, with no support, with no backing. So when I say \"clean water was only served to the fairer skinned\" what I\\'m saying is we\\'re making products with chitlins. T-SHIRTS! That\\'s the most we can make! T-shirts. We could have our best perspective on t-shirts. But if it\\'s anything else...\\n*HAND SMACK*\\nyour Truman Show boat is hitting the wall. And what\\'s more important to me about this than everything I can do sonically and everything is, if I go somewhere else and someone says, \"Hey, we don\\'t like Kanye West\" you\\'ve heard that before, right? What people don\\'t realize is I want to make uniforms for my high school basketball team through Brand Yeezy. I want to make that one step, and then make another step, and eventually do uniforms for the entire city, then I want those uniforms to be hot and make money, then I eventually want to be the anchor and the force behind a billion dollar company and after I make that billion dollar step, then I can go in and say I have an opinion on this and that could be a ten billion dollar step, I eventually want to be the anchor of the first trillion dollar company. But when you sit and you have a meeting with a company and show them the most innovate take on theatre because you thought of it one night when you were sitting on top of Watch The Throne set which you designed with Es Devlin, and I designed the set with Es Devlin and thought of, \"Ok, surround vision, there should be a screen above you, below you, to the left, to the right of you and one in front of you also\" then I paid my own money that I get paid for doing Gold Digger, which I never really liked that song but I always knew I would get paid for doing Gold Digger, then I shoot a film in Qatar with three camera crews, with Nate Brown, Virgil, Matt Williams, Nabil, all of these crew- all of the people that every video that pops up every other day on Hypebeast thats my crew, right? So, we go out and shoot that, 3 camera crews over 5 days edited over 30 days, show it at amfAR- no, show it in Cannes, the night before amfAR on the beach, build it in a pyramid with Rem Koolhaas\\' agency, design the entire thing, put editors in it, blah blah blah, people give a standing ovation, I do an interview in New York Times the next year to say, \"Hey, I did this and I want to let you know I did it\", right? And then, it doesn\\'t get mentioned in the interview and a week later they do an interview with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg and they\\'re talking about what the next frontier of theatre will be and how it\\'ll be higher priced tickets and it\\'ll be something that\\'s surrounding you and blah blah blah, maybe it\\'s in the goggles, I said, \"Wait a second, I just only did the interview to tell people that I invented it. I made it.\"\\nLike I went, I remember when I was, uh, dropping William Morris, right, and then Sarah Newkirk at that time said \"Before you drop them, go meet with Ari Emanuel\" and I sat with him and I said, \"Ari, I\\'m an inventor\" and he goes on to tell me about the way it works and what he said was \"You are a celebrity. So basically what\\'s going to happen is, there\\'s product here, and this is where you end up, right here. If you can communicate the product you can make money of the product, cause look at Gaga. She\\'s the Creative Director of Polaroid.\" I like some the Gaga songs. What the fuck does she know about cameras? So it becomes all of this thing where all of the musicians- the musicians try to get more money by promoting other products, right? So you\\'ll say \"Hey, you know what? I\\'ve got this water and we\\'ve got, you know, we\\'ve got this red version. We got a red bottle, and we\\'ve got a David Beckham version here, then we got a blue version.\" So my opinion is no more than the patina on top of it, when I understand the reason from my core of why something should work all the way through. So, I understand we want to make it about music but I wanted to take this step to say, we got this new thing called \"Classism\". It\\'s racism\\'s cousin. This is what we do to hold people back. This is what we do. And we got this other thing we got that has been working for a long time where you don\\'t have to be racist anymore it\\'s called \"Self-Hate\"; it works on itself. It\\'s like real estate of racism. Where, just like that, when someone comes up and says something like \"I am a god\", everybody says \"Who does he think he is?\" I just told you who I thought I am, a god! I just told you! That\\'s who I think I am! Would it have been better if I had a song that said, \"I am a nigga\"? or if I had song that said \"I am a gangsta\"? or if I had song that said \"I am a pimp\"? All those color and patinas fit better on a person like me, right? But to say you are a god? Especially, when you got shipped over to the country that you\\'re in, and your last name is a slave owners. How can you say that; how could you have that mentality?\\nZL: I mean, I know in the past you\\'ve talked about, like, you know, building hotels, doing things beyond people\\'s normal frame of reference. They know you as Kanye West, an artist. They know you\\'re moving into fashion, but these things in a way I guess are hard on people to comprehend because they don\\'t have that level of drive. Do you know what I mean? Has it always been like this for you? Have you always felt like you can set your mind on anything and you will achieve it, ultimately?\\nKW: I\\'ve always felt I can do anything. That\\'s the main thing people are controlled by, thoughts- the perceptions of themselves. They\\'re slowed down by the perception of themselves. If you\\'re taught you can\\'t do anything you won\\'t do anything. I was taught I could do everything and I\\'m Kanye West at age 36. So just watch the next ten years.\\nZL: Yea yea yea.',\n",

       "   'lyrics': 'Well seeing that, I think I, maybe for one of the first times in my life, I understand how it is to feel humbled. I want to say some \"thank you\"s really quick. Thank God for Stephen Hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn\\'t care about what Ghost somebody\\'s driving or how big somebody\\'s house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. So, make some noise for Stephen Hill to start this\\nSo, since this is pre-taped and the fact that Adam Blackstone used to be my music director, I\\'m pretty sure he\\'s not gonna start the music on me. If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visited Minister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years. And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, \"You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon\\' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon\\' go and get a rich black dude.\" But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it ain\\'t got nothing to do with the money\\nAnd it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father, Robert Kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his Bentley, they wrote \"Nigga lover\" because Robert Kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got O.J. off. She had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. And he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, \"Dad why you going so crazy?\" He said to her, \"One day you may have a black child. A beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. And it\\'s gonna be hard, you\\'re gonna see how hard it is.\"\\nSo, true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. The bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why I\\'m not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of people\\'s perception of celebrity, because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner. And they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy idea\\nHarriet Tubman said she could have freed so many more, and I\\'m sorry mom if that was incorrect English. Harriet Tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren\\'t free. So don\\'t think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that we\\'re free. And don\\'t think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we\\'re free. And don\\'t think that because it\\'s 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that we\\'re free. It\\'s the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. Slaves to the perception. Slaves to the idea of being cool\\nI thought it was so appropriate the way Wayne Brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. For us to express ourselves. Our power, our oil, since we don\\'t own any oil. Our oil is our expression, is our influence. Don\\'t never let them take that away. And when we have the chance to express it and influence, don\\'t only do it for us, do it for the human race',\n",

       "    'lyrics': 'Well seeing that, I think I, maybe for one of the first times in my life, I understand how it is to feel humbled. I want to say some \"thank you\"s really quick. Thank God for Stephen Hill, who is so sincerely good at exactly what he does and gives so much and doesn\\'t care about what Ghost somebody\\'s driving or how big somebody\\'s house is and brings the most awesome collection of classic, current, and futuristic black music every day. So, make some noise for Stephen Hill to start this\\nSo, since this is pre-taped and the fact that Adam Blackstone used to be my music director, I\\'m pretty sure he\\'s not gonna start the music on me. If I go Chicago for a second, you know it was interesting when I went and visited Minister Louis Farrakhan, and I just really wanted to expand so much more on the things that I had been talking about over the past couple years. And it was interesting or groundbreaking and really special for me to see his reaction and his expression about my relationship with a woman not of color, and for us to focus on the idea of love and not the idea of separation. You know, at the barbershop and everything, I used to hear people talking about, \"You know when an entertainer get on, of course you know he gon\\' go and get a white girl and buy her all this... and the white girl gon\\' go and get a rich black dude.\" But I want to say that my wife has dated broke black dudes. So it ain\\'t got nothing to do with the money\\nAnd it takes me back to a story that she told me where her father, Robert Kardashian, walked out, and on the side of his Bentley, they wrote \"Nigga lover\" because Robert Kardashian was the genius that put together the defense team that got O.J. off. She had never seen her father curse, get mad, he was the most laid back human being. And he went so crazy and tried to chase the people down, and she sat there crying and said, \"Dad why you going so crazy?\" He said to her, \"One day you may have a black child. A beautiful, beautiful, beautiful black child. And it\\'s gonna be hard, you\\'re gonna see how hard it is.\"\\nSo, true enough, we deal with racism because there are different races, or the micro of it is that we focus on the different races, as opposed to the macro, which is the human race. The bit of soundbytes that everyone loved from last year that got taken out of context or misunderstood did come from a place of saying part of the reason why I\\'m not allowed to be empowered is because of race, because of people\\'s perception of celebrity, because all they want to present to young black men is the idea of making it to the league or making it to be a rapper, but not the idea of becoming an owner. And they would do anything they can to make it seem like a truthful idea is a stupid idea or a crazy idea\\nHarriet Tubman said she could have freed so many more, and I\\'m sorry mom if that was incorrect English. Harriet Tubman could have freed more if they only knew they weren\\'t free. So don\\'t think that because we can afford this custom Balmain suit that we\\'re free. And don\\'t think that because we can buy a $300,000 car that we\\'re free. And don\\'t think that because it\\'s 3% of a gated community that has colored people in it that we\\'re free. It\\'s the mentality, the slave mentality, where we all eventually become slaves to that car. Slaves to the perception. Slaves to the idea of being cool\\nI thought it was so appropriate the way Wayne Brady kicked his whole shit off tonight. For us to express ourselves. Our power, our oil, since we don\\'t own any oil. Our oil is our expression, is our influence. Don\\'t never let them take that away. And when we have the chance to express it and influence, don\\'t only do it for us, do it for the human race',\n",
